"A methyl pivalate (MP) based electrolyte was for the first time reported for non-aqueous lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. This new electrolyte in both superoxide radical solution and a real Li-O-2 battery environment showed good chemical stability against superoxide radicals, which was confirmed by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR measurements.",3
"The application of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in conjunction with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is demonstrated as a powerful analytical combination for screening of electrolyte candidates for Lithium-Air (Li-Air) battery systems. Both analytical techniques are employed to examine electrochemical kinetics at the electrolyte-electrodes interfaces, decomposition of the electrolyte candidates, and Li-Air battery cycling performance. Correlations of the changes in the EIS spectra with variations in the electrolytes chemical condition and degree of degradation via NMR are presented, leading to a better understanding of the electrochemical kinetics at the air cathode, identification of design principles for stable electrolytes, and more accurate insights in their decomposition patterns. The approach is used to develop advanced battery components such as stable electrolytes and cathodes with well-structured architecture to provide substantially higher specific energy and longer battery cycle life.

"A novel electrolyte with chloromethyl pivalate (CP) used as solvent was first reported for non-aqueous lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. Since there are no alpha-H atoms in the structure of CP, the CP based electrolyte in both superoxide radical solution and real Li-O-2 battery environment showed good chemical stability against superoxide radicals, which was confirmed by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR measurements. Without a catalyst in the cathode of Li-O-2 batteries, the batteries showed high specific capacity and cycling stability.

"The demand for high-performance, affordable, and safe energy storage solutions is growing, driven in part by the incorporation of fluctuating electricity sources like wind turbines and solar cells in the electric grid. Batteries offer such a storage solution in both distributed systems such as households and large-scale industrial systems. The quest for more resource-efficient alternatives to lithium-ion batteries is on its way to meet the increasing demand. Zinc batteries are particularly ecologically friendly due to their use of abundant raw materials and their facile recyclability. High energy densities add to the benefits of this technology. These advantages stem from the use of zinc metal electrodes in combination with effective and affordable aqueous electrolytes. Zinc battery types are distinguished by their cathode materials and electrolytic charge carriers. Zinc-air batteries work with oxygen from air and have the potential to offer the highest energy densities. Zinc-flow batteries could enable large scale battery storage. Zinc-ion batteries are a more recent development which promise large power densities and long cycle lives. In this review, these technologies are discussed in detail. We summarize the development status of each technology, criticize typical deficiencies of current studies, discuss technological challenges, and highlight promising future research directions.",12
"Aqueous rechargeable zinc-based batteries have sparked a lot of enthusiasm in the energy storage field recently due to their inherent safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Although remarkable progress has been made in the exploration of performance so far, there are still many challenges such as low working voltage and dissolution of electrode materials at the material and system level. Herein, the central tenet is to establish a systematic summary for the construction and mechanism of different aqueous zinc-based batteries. Details for three major zinc-based battery systems, including alkaline rechargeable Zn-based batteries (ARZBs), aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs), and dual-ion hybrid Zn batteries (DHZBs) are given. First, the electrode materials and energy storage mechanism of the three types of zinc-based batteries are discussed to provide universal guidance for these batteries. Then, the electrode behavior of zinc anodes and strategies to deal with problems such as dendrite and passivation are recommended. Finally, some challenge-oriented solutions are provided to facilitate the next development of zinc-based batteries. Combining the characteristics of zinc-based batteries with good use of concepts and ideas from other disciplines will surely pave the way for its commercialization.",9
"Zinc–air is a century-old battery technology but has attracted revived interest recently. With larger storage capacity at a fraction of the cost compared to lithium-ion, zinc–air batteries clearly represent one of the most viable future options to powering electric vehicles. However, some technical problems associated with them have yet to be resolved. In this review, we present the fundamentals, challenges and latest exciting advances related to zinc–air research. Detailed discussion will be organized around the individual components of the system – from zinc electrodes, electrolytes, and separators to air electrodes and oxygen electrocatalysts in sequential order for both primary and electrically/mechanically rechargeable types. The detrimental effect of CO2 on battery performance is also emphasized, and possible solutions summarized. Finally, other metal–air batteries are briefly overviewed and compared in favor of zinc–air.",16
"The dendritic issue in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZBs) using neutral/mild electrolytes has remained an intensive controversy for a long time: some researchers assert that dendrites severely exist while others claim great cycling stability without any protection. This issue is clarified by investigating charge/discharge-condition-dependent formation of Zn dendrites. Lifespan degradation (120 to 1.2 h) and voltage hysteresis deterioration (134 to 380 mV) are observed with increased current densities due to the formation of Zn dendrites (edge size: 0.69–4.37 µm). In addition, the capacity is also found to remarkably affect the appearance of the dendrites as well. Therefore, at small current densities or loading mass, Zn dendrites might not be an issue, while the large conditions may rapidly ruin batteries. Based on this discovery, a first-in-class electrohealing methodology is developed to eliminate already-formed dendrites, generating extremely prolonged lifespans by 410% at 7.5 mA cm–2 and 516% at 10 mA cm–2. Morphological analysis reveals that vertically aligned Zn dendrites with sharp tips gradually become passivated and finally generate a smooth surface. This developed electrohealing strategy may promote research on metal dendrites in various batteries evolving from passive prevention to active elimination, rescuing in-service batteries in situ to achieve elongated lifetime.",12
"Metal–air batteries are becoming of particular interest, from both fundamental and industrial viewpoints, for their high specific energy density compared to other energy storage devices, in particular the Li-ion systems. Among metal–air batteries, the zinc–air option represents a safe, environmentally friendly and potentially cheap and simple way to store and deliver electrical energy for both portable and stationary devices as well as for electric vehicles. Zinc–air batteries can be classified into primary (including also the mechanically rechargeable), electrically rechargeable (secondary), and fuel cells. Research on primary zinc–air batteries is well consolidated since many years. On the contrary, research on the electrically rechargeable ones still requires further efforts to overcome materials science and electrochemical issues related to charge and discharge processes. In addition, zinc–air fuel cells are also of great potential interest for smart grid energy storage and production. This review aims to report on the latest progresses and state-of-the-art of primary, secondary and mechanically rechargeable zinc–air batteries, and zinc–air fuel cells. In particular, this review focuses on the critical aspects of materials science, engineering, electrochemistry and mathematical modeling related to all zinc–air systems.",16
"This article reviews the current status of the research and development programs, in the USA, on rechargeable zinc batteries. The review is confined to systems that are now under development. These are the zinc-bromine, zinc-chlorine, zinc-ferricyanide and zinc-nickel oxide systems. Most of the electrochemical problems with these batteries are due to the zinc electrode. Recent advances in zinc batteries include the use of additives and modified charging methods. Recent work by the author and others on the mechanism of the zinc electrodes in acid electrolytes is discussed and the mechanistic aspects of the effect of additives and charging methods is also reviewed.",12
"Zinc-ion batteries built on water-based electrolytes featuring compelling price-points, competitive performance, and enhanced safety represent advanced energy storage chemistry as a promising alternative to current lithium-ion battery systems. Attempts to develop rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) can be traced to as early as the 1980s; however, since 2015, the research activity in this field has surged throughout the world. Despite the achievements made in exploring electrode materials so far, significant challenges remain at the material level and even on the whole aqueous ZIBs system, leading to the failure of ZIBs to meet commercial requirements. This review aims to discuss how to pave the way for developing aqueous ZIBs. The current research efforts related to aqueous ZIBs electrode materials and electrolytes are summarized, including an analysis of the problems encountered in both cathode/anode materials and electrolyte optimization. Some concerns and feasible solutions for achieving practical aqueous ZIBs are discussed in detail. We would like to point out that merely improving the electrode materials is not enough; synergistic optimization strategies toward the whole battery system are also deeply needed. Finally, some perspectives are provided on the subsequent optimization design for further research efforts in the aqueous ZIB field.",9
"The next generation of high-performance batteries should include alternative chemistries that are inherently safer to operate than nonaqueous lithium-based batteries. Aqueous zinc-based batteries can answer that challenge because monolithic zinc sponge anodes can be cycled in nickel–zinc alkaline cells hundreds to thousands of times without undergoing passivation or macroscale dendrite formation. We demonstrate that the three-dimensional (3D) zinc form-factor elevates the performance of nickel–zinc alkaline cells in three fields of use: (i) >90% theoretical depth of discharge (DODZn) in primary (single-use) cells, (ii) >100 high-rate cycles at 40% DODZn at lithium-ion–commensurate specific energy, and (iii) the tens of thousands of power-demanding duty cycles required for start-stop microhybrid vehicles.",12
"The spatial distribution of charge carriers in lithium ion batteries during current flow is of fundamental interest for a detailed understanding of transport properties and the development of strategies for future improvements of the electrolyte-electrode interface behaviour. In this work we explored the potential of Li-7 1D in situ NMR imaging for the identification of concentration gradients under constant current load in a battery cell. An electrochemical cell based on PTFE body and a stack of glass microfiber discs that are soaked with a technically relevant electrolyte suitable for high-temperature application and squeezed between a Li metal and a nano-Si-graphite composite electrode was assembled to acquire Li-7 1D in situ NMR profiles with an improved NMR pulse sequence as function of time and state of charge, thereby visualizing the course of ion concentration during charge and discharge. Surface localized changes of Li concentration were attributed to processes such as solid electrolyte interphase formation or full lithiation of the composite electrode. The method allows the extraction of lithium ion transport properties.",4
"Sodium-ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium-ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium-ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high-grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi-gram scale synthesis of NaPF6 in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3 M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal-electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (>2 M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1 M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.",4
"Electrolytes play an important role in transporting metal ions (e.g., Li+) in metal ion batteries, while understanding the relationship between the electrolyte properties and behaviors is still challenging. Herein, we detect the existence of weak solvent-solvent interactions in electrolytes by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), particularly discovering that such interactions have a significant function of stabilizing the electrolytes, which has never been reported before. As a paradigm, we renovated the understanding of the role of ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent in the lithium-ion battery electrolyte. We find that the EC solvent can stabilize the linear carbonate solvent electrolyte, particularly the diethyl carbonate (DEC) electrolyte, by the weak intermolecular interactions, enhancing the energy difference between the orbitals of the Li+(EC)(x)(DEC)(y) complex, in turn demonstrating strong capability against reduction. Our viewpoint was further demonstrated in other metal ion batteries (e.g., Na+, K+), whose discovery is significant for designing electrolytes and in-depth understanding of the battery performance.",2
"Improving transport properties of electrolytes is important for developing lithium-ion batteries for future energy storage applications. In Newman's concentrated solution theory, electrolytes are characterized by three transport parameters, conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and transference number, in addition to the thermodynamic factor. In this work, these parameters are all determined for an exemplar liquid electrolyte, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide mixed in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, using electrochemical methods. The intrinsic coupling between parameters obtained by electrochemical methods results in large error bars in the transference number that obscure the transport behavior of the electrolyte. Here, we use electrophoretic NMR (eNMR) to measure the electric-field-induced ion and solvent velocities to obtain the transference number directly, which enables determination of the thermodynamic factor with greater certainty. Our work indicates that the combination of eNMR and electrochemical methods provides a robust approach for complete characterization of battery electrolytes.",2
"Electrolyte decomposition in Li-ion batteries (LIB) and its entailing gas evolution significantly impacts cell performance. CO2 is one of the most abundantly evolved gases from common LIB electrolytes and could potentially affect Li+ solution transport during LIB operation. To this end, a comparative analysis of the Li+ diffusion coefficient (DLi+) which governs mass transport is required. Herein a methodology is established to saturate common battery electrolytes with a soluble gas without introducing other contaminants, so as to determine DLi+ in saturated and unsaturated samples. As a proof of concept, the values of DLi+ are determined in 1 M LiPF6 and 1 M LiClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with and without dissolved CO2, confirmed by gas chromatography?mass spectrometry (GC?MS). The results obtained by pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) diffusion measurements agree for both electrolytes; saturating the electrolyte with CO2 has no measurable effect on DLi+ and therefore does not hinder Li+ mass transport.",2
"Aluminum bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Al(TFSI)(3)) was synthesized by a simple substitution reaction and investigated as the Al3+ source for the electrolyte of a rechargeable Al battery. The electrochemical window was extended to 3.6 V with the electrolyte containing Al(TFSI)(3) in AN, whereas it was similar to 2.5 V with the conventional electrolyte for the Al rechargeable battery. A reversible electrochemical Al deposition/dissolution reaction was observed on a Mo plate electrode with small overpotential less than 0.5 V. NMR and Raman spectra identified the main Al species in the electrolyte as Al(TFSI-)(x)(AN)(6-x)(3-x) (x = 1 similar to 6). (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.",2
"Flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl phosphate) (TCP) is successfully encapsulated in core-shell poly(urea-formaldehyde) microcapsules by in situ polymerization. The microcapsules are electrochemically stable in lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery electrolytes and thermally stable to ca. 200 degrees C. Thermal triggering of these microcapsules at higher temperatures ruptures the shell wall, releasing the liquid core (flame retardant), and NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence of the flame retardant in the electrolyte solution. Li-ion pouch cell experiments demonstrate that microencapsulation of TCP and its incorporation into the battery electrolyte provide latent fire retardants that improve battery safety while maintaining inherent battery performance and cycling capability.",4
"We evaluate hydrofluoroether (HFE) cosolvents with varying degrees of fluorination in the acetonitrile-based solvate electrolyte to determine the effect of the HFE structure on the electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery. Solvates or sparingly solvating electrolytes are an interesting electrolyte choice for the Li-S battery due to their low polysulfide solubility. The solvate electrolyte with a stoichiometric ratio of LiTFSI salt in acetonitrile, (MeCN)(2)-LiTFSI, exhibits limited polysulfide solubility due to the high concentration of LiTFSI. We demonstrate that the addition of highly fluorinated HFEs to the solvate yields better capacity retention compared to that of less fluorinated HFE cosolvents. Raman and NMR spectroscopy coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that HFEs exhibiting a higher degree of fluorination coordinate to Li+ at the expense of MeCN coordination, resulting in higher free MeCN content in solution. However, the polysulfide solubility remains low, and no crossover of polysulfides from the S cathode to the Li anode is observed.",4
"Al-ion batteries employing natural graphite cathodes have been proposed as a valid alternative to Li-ion systems due to their low-cost and sustainability, as well as a stable long-term cycle life. In contrast to commonly used but typically expensive ionic-liquid-based electrolytes, our reported Al-graphite batteries use AlCl3/urea and AlCl3/acetamide deep eutectic solvents (DES, also known as ionic liquid analogues) as low-cost alternative. By carefully selecting amide composition, Al speciation in the DES electrolyte can be modified, as confirmed by Raman, NMR and IR spectroscopy. We correlate the speciation changes to resulting battery performance by systematic electrochemical investigations of Al-graphite batteries employing urea and acetamide eutectics of different compositions. The practical applicability was demonstrated using long-term cycling experiments with >8000 cycles, exhibiting a specific capacity of around 50 mAh/g at a current rate of 2 A/g.",4
"In this protocol, we describe the quantification of electrolytes using nuclear magnetic resonance. We detail the steps involved for battery cycling, sample preparation, instrument operation, and data analysis. The protocol can be used to quantify electrolyte decomposition reactions and the apparent electron transfer numbers of different electrolyte components. The protocol is optimized for lithium-based anode-free batteries but can also be applied to other rechargeable batteries.For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Zhou et al. (2022).1",4
"Fundamental characterization of battery electrolyte is vital for rechargeable batteries. This work reports the chemical stability of sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6)-based non-aqueous electrolytes containing different solvent mixtures (e.g., cyclic and acyclic carbonates) in the presence of water for Na-ion batteries. A degradation study is conducted using NaPF6-based electrolytes, highlighting two electrolyte additives, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy-2,2,2-ethoxy phosphazene (FM2) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), on degradation and cell performance of Na-ion batteries. Hydrolysis of NaPF6 in acidic condition is particularly prone to form hydrofluoric acid (HF), and can be observed in electrolytes made with battery grade carbonate solvents (<20 ppm of water). Degradation mechanisms of NaPF6-based electrolytes are studied using liquid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Noticeable degradation takes place in high purity electrolytes with the presence of moisture to form HF and organophosphates in timeframes below the current shelf-life of the Na electrolytes. FEC is not efficient to protect the electrodes from being exposed to HF. On the other hand, FM2 is revealed as a scavenger of HF, which helps stabilize the shelf life of electrolytes that might contain or become exposed to water. Our study underscores the importance to understanding the degradation of electrolyte and improving stability toward better shelf life for sodium ion batteries.",4
"Lithium-sulfur batteries offer the highest theoretical energy density among enclosed rechargeable batteries. However, there are various issues that need to be addressed before their practical adoption, such as the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn) into the electrolyte solution, which causes rapid degradation of the battery. Herein, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and in-situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the dissolution of the intermediate species formed during the discharge-charge process in Li-S batteries. A strong enhancement in the MRI signal was observed when the cell was first discharged, which is associated with the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. To determine the origin of this signal enhancement, H-1 NMR spectra, T(1 )relaxation time, and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed on electrolyte containing polysulfides. The origin of the strong enhancement of the MRI signal by the dissoluted polysulfides is mainly attributed to the paramagnetic interaction due to the formation of S-3*(- )and S-4*(- )radicals in the dissoluted polysulfides. The results demonstrate that H-1 MRI is an indirect and effective way to study and visualize the intermediate species formed during Li-S battery operation.",8
"Air-aged LiFePO4 exhibits an OH-rich surface that reacts with LiPF6 based electrolyte, leading to poor battery performance. We show that outstanding electrochemical performance is achieved when using air-aged LiFePO4 in the presence of electrolyte additive N,N-diethylamino trimethylsilane, capable of reacting with acidic impurities. Stable impedance is obtained upon cycling, and Li-7 and F-19 MAS NMR study indicates that the interphasial chemistry is governed by a surface layer coming from reacted additive.

"We propose in this work a polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (MW 500) dissolving lithium trifluoromethansulfonate (LiCF3SO3) salt as suitable electrolyte media for a safe and efficient use of the lithium metal anode in battery. Voltammetry and galvanostatic tests reveal significant enhancement of the electrolyte characteristics, in terms of cycling life and chemical stability, by the addition of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) to the solution. Furthermore, PFG NMR measurements suggest the applicability of the electrolyte in battery in terms of ionic conductivity, lithium transference number, ionic-association degree and self-diffusion coefficient. Accordingly, the electrolyte is employed in a lithium battery using lithium iron phosphate as the selected cathode. The battery delivers a stable capacity of 150 rnAh g(-1) and flat working voltage of 3.5 V, thus leading to a theoretical energy density referred to the cathode of 520 Wh kg(-1). This battery is considered a suitable energy storage system for advanced applications requiring both high safety and high energy density. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2
"Lithium-ion batteries are electrochemical storage devices using the electrochemical activity of the lithium ion in relation to intercalation compounds owing to mass transport phenomena through diffusion. Diffusion of the lithium ion in the electrode pores has been poorly understood due to the lack of experimental techniques for measuring its self-diffusion coefficient in porous media. Magic-Angle Spinning, Pulsed Field Gradient, Stimulated-Echo Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-PFG-STE NMR) was used here for the first time to measure the self-diffusion coefficients of the electrolyte species in the LP30 battery electrolyte (i.e. a 1 M solution of LiPF6 dissolved in 1:1 Ethylene Carbonate - Dimethyl Carbonate) in model composites. These composite electrodes were made of alumina, carbon black and PVdF-HFP. Alumina's magnetic susceptibility is close to the measured magnetic susceptibility of the LP30 electrolyte thereby limiting undesirable internal field gradients. Interestingly, the self-diffusion coefficient of lithium ions decreases with increasing carbon content. FIB-SEM was used to describe the 3D geometry of the samples. The comparison between the reduction of self-diffusion coefficients as measured by PFG-NMR and as geometrically derived from FIB/SEM tortuosity values highlights the contribution of specific interactions at the material/electrolyte interface on the lithium transport properties.

"Solid lithium ion electrolyte is a critical component for the development of all solid state lithium ion battery. In this study, a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), PVO is successfully prepared using the monomers of 1-vinylimidazole (1-Vm) and oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl ether methacrylate (OE) to investigate the introduction of small amount of imidazole moiety (8.3 mol%) of high coordination capability and its effect on lithium ion conductivity. LiTFSI and LiClO4 are used to compare the effect from different types of lithium salt, their concentrations are regulated from 5 wt% to 20 wt%. The highest lithium ion conductivities of 1.30 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C and 2.57 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 70 °C are obtained when the content of LiTFSI is 15 wt%. Generally, when LiClO4 is used, the ionic conductivity of SPE is lower than that when LiTFSI is used. But the lithium transference number with LiClO4 is higher than LiTFSI. Both types of lithium salt show similar and relatively high electrochemical stability up to 4.7 V versus Li+/Li, and good cycling performances in lithium deposition/stripping experiments. Though imidazole group is able to coordinate to Lewis acid as used in organic synthesis, and may seriously bother the transportation of lithium ion, however the study doesn’t show the evidence. The findings may allow the design of more delicate chemical and aggregate structure in the explore of new lithium ion conducting materials.",2
"LiBOB (lithium bis(oxalato)-borate) based electrolytes for high power Li-ion batteries are prepared by dissolving different concentrations of LiBOB into two different types of liquid solvents, gamma-Butyrolactone (gamma-BL) and propylene carbonate (PC). The ionic conductivity, solubility, and viscosity of the as-prepared electrolytes are characterized and compared. Raman spectroscopic and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) are employed to investigate the fundamental solvation interactions of the LiBOB with the two types of solvents. The results indicate that lithium cation tends to coordinate with the carbonyl functional group of gamma-BL. In contrast, it exists mainly through ion-pairing in PC solvent. By fitting the Raman spectra, the solvation numbers for both electrolytes are calculated and compared, which would further help understand the observed difference in ionic conductivity shown by these two electrolytes.

"The structure and dynamics of polymer network electrolytes for lithium batteries based on polyester diacrylate, lithium perchlorate, and ethylene carbonate were studied. The polyester diacrylate contained diacrylate units, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate units, and product of dimerization of the initial monomer (to 10% by mass). An (1) H NMR study revealed three phases corresponding to ethylene carbonate in the polymer, ethylene carbonate bound to Li+ ions, and cyclic dimer of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate.",2
"A successful strategy for improving the safety issues of new-generation lithium-ion batteries is to replace liquid electrolytes with solid or quasi-solid membranes, a procedure that ensures adequate ionic conductions and are mechanical strengths.",2
"Thermal degradation products in lithium-ion batteries result mainly from hydrolysis sensitivity of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6). As organic carbonate solvents contain traces of protic impurities, the thermal decomposition of electrolytes is enhanced. Therefore, resulting degradation products are studied with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). The electrolyte contains 1 M LiPF6 in a binary mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) in a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) and is aged at ambient and elevated temperature. The impact of protic impurities, either added as deionized water or incorporated in positive electrode material, upon aging is investigated. Further, the influence of different housing materials on the electrolyte degradation is shown. Difluorophosphoric acid is identified as main decomposition product by NMR-spectroscopy. Traces of other decomposition products are determined by headspace GC MS. Acid-base and coulometric titration are used to determine the total amount of acid and water content upon aging, respectively. The aim of this investigation is to achieve profound understanding about the thermal decomposition of one most common used electrolyte in a battery-like housing material. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"While lithium metal represents the ultimate high-energy-density battery anode material, its use is limited by dendrite formation and associated safety risks, motivating studies of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer that forms on the lithium, which is key in controlling lithium metal deposition. Dynamic nuclear polarisation enhanced NMR can provide important structural information; however, typical exogenous dynamic nuclear polarisation experiments, in which organic radicals are added to the sample, require cryogenic sample cooling and are not selective for the interface between the metal and the solid-electrolyte interphase. Here we instead exploit the conduction electrons of lithium metal to achieve an order of magnitude hyperpolarisation at room temperature. We enhance the Li-7, H-1 and F-19 NMR spectra of solid-electrolyte interphase species selectively, revealing their chemical nature and spatial distribution. These experiments pave the way for more ambitious room temperature in situ dynamic nuclear polarisation studies of batteries and the selective enhancement of metal-solid interfaces in a wider range of systems. Understanding the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is key to developing safe dendrite-free lithium batteries. Here, by exploiting the electrons in lithium metal to selectively hyperpolarise the NMR signals, the authors reveal the chemistry and spatial distribution of species at the metal-SEI interface.",10
"The electrolyte is a crucial component of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, as it controls polysulfide dissolution, charge shuttling processes, and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation. Experimentally, the overall performance of Li-S batteries varies with choice of solvent system and Li-salt used in the electrolyte, and a lack of predictive understanding about the effects of individual electrolyte components inhibits the rational design of electrolytes for Li-S batteries. Here we analyze the role of the counteranions of common Li-salts (such as TfO-, FSI-, TFSI-, and TDI-) when dissolved in DOL/DME (1:1 by vol.) for use in Li-S batteries. The evolution of ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions due to various anions was analyzed using O-17 NMR and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR and then correlated with electrochemical performance in Li-S cells. These data reveal that the formation of the passivation layer on the anode and the loss of active materials from the cathode (evidenced by polysulfide dissolution) are related to anion mobility and affinity with lithium polysulfide, respectively. For future electrolyte design, anions with lower mobility and weaker interactions with lithium polysulfides may be superior candidates for increasing the long-term stability of Li-S batteries.",10
"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent platforms to design hybrid electrolytes for Li batteries with liquid-like transport and stability against lithium dendrites. We report on Li+ dynamics in quasi-solid electrolytes consisting in Mg-MOF-74 soaked with LiClO4-propylene carbonate (PC) and LiClO4-ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solutions by combining studies of ion conductivity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization, and spin relaxometry. We investigate nanoconfinement of liquid inside MOFs to characterize the adsorption/solvation mechanism at the basis of Li+ migration in these materials. NMR supports that the liquid is nanoconfined in framework micropores, strongly interacting with their walls and that the nature of the solvent affects Li+ migration in MOFs. Contrary to the free liquid electrolytes, faster ion dynamics and higher Li+ mobility take place in LiClO4-PC electrolytes when nanoconfined in MOFs demonstrating superionic conductor behavior (conductivity sigma(rt) > 0.1 mS cm(-1), transport number t(Li)+ > 0.7). Such properties, including a more stable Li electrodeposition, make MOF-hybrid electrolytes promising for high-power and safer lithium-ion batteries.",10
"We illustrate a simple and effective electrolyte extraction methodology from commercial 18650 lithium-ion cells. This methodology is based on a liquid-liquid extraction step, which is highlighted for robustness, reproducibility, and reliability. We assess the consumption of electrolyte by tracking compositional changes using liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, supported by differential thermal analysis (DTA) before and after cell cycling. An analysis method that monitors compositional dynamics is presented and shows the impact of these changes throughout a cell's lifetime. Such methodology can be employed in the understanding of electrolyte degradation mechanisms to enhance the understanding of performance fade in commercial cells. Moreover, it will help build robust mathematical models that are able to predict the drive of cell degradation and ultimate failure.",10
The high flammability and thermal instability of conventional carbonate electrolytes limit the safety and performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and other electrochemical energy storage devices. Organosilicon solvents have shown promise due to their reduced flammability and greater chemical stability at high temperatures. A series of organosilicon electrolytes with different functional substituents were studied to understand the structural origins of this enhanced stability. The thermal and hydrolytic stability of organosilicon and carbonate solvents with LiPF6 was probed by storage at high temperatures and with added water. Quantitative monitoring of organosilicon and carbonate electrolyte decomposition products over time using NMR spectroscopy revealed mechanisms of degradation and led to the discovery of a key PF5-complex that forms in organosilicon electrolytes to inhibit further salt breakdown. Increased knowledge of specific structural contributions to electrolyte stability informs the development of future electrolyte solvents to enable the safer operation of high-performing lithium-ion batteries.

"We have developed and explored the use of a new Automatic Tuning Matching Cycler (ATMC) in situ NMR probe system to track the formation of intermediate phases and investigate electrolyte decomposition during electrochemical cycling of Li- and Na-ion batteries (LIBs and NIBs). The new approach addresses many of the issues arising during in situ NMR, e.g., significantly different shifts of the multi-component samples, changing sample conditions (such as the magnetic susceptibility and conductivity) during cycling, signal broadening due to paramagnetism as well as interferences between the NMR and external cycler circuit that might impair the experiments. We provide practical insight into how to conduct ATMC in situ NMR experiments and discuss applications of the methodology to LiFePO4 (LFP) and Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 cathodes as well as Na metal anodes. Automatic frequency sweep Li-7 in situ NMR reveals significant changes of the strongly paramagnetic broadened LFP line shape in agreement with the structural changes due to delithiation. Additionally, P-31 in situ NMR shows a full separation of the electrolyte and cathode NMR signals and is a key feature fora deeper understanding of the processes occurring during charge/discharge on the local atomic scale of NMR. P-31 in situ NMR with on-the-fly re-calibrated, varying carrier frequencies on Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 as a cathode in a NIB enabled the detection of different P signals within a huge frequency range of 4000 ppm. The experiments show a significant shift and changes in the number as well as intensities of P-31 signals during desodiation/sodiation of the cathode. The in situ experiments reveal changes of local P environments that in part have not been seen in ex situ NMR investigations. Furthermore, we applied ATMC Na-23 in situ NMR on symmetrical Na-Na cells during galvanostatic plating. An automatic adjustment of the NMR carrier frequency during the in situ experiment ensured on resonance conditions for the Na metal and electrolyte peak, respectively. Thus, interleaved measurements with different optimal NMR set-ups for the metal and electrolyte, respectively, became possible. This allowed the formation of different Na metal species as well as a quantification of electrolyte consumption during the electrochemical experiment to be monitored. The new approach is likely to benefit a further understanding of Na-ion battery chemistries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",16
"Rechargeable Mg batteries have been regarded as a viable battery technology for grid scale energy storage and transportation applications. However, the limited performance of Mg2+ electrolytes has been a primary technical hurdle to develop high energy density rechargeable Mg batteries. In this study, MgCl2 is demonstrated as a non-nucleophilic and cheap Mg2+ source in combination with Al Lewis acids (AlCl3, AlPh3 and AlEtCl2) to formulate a series of Mg2+ electrolytes, representing the simplest method to prepare Mg2+ conductive electrolytes (no precursor synthesis, free of recrystallization and giving quantitative yield). These electrolytes are characterized by high oxidation stability (up to 3.4 V vs. Mg), improved electrophile compatibility and electrochemical reversibility (up to 100% coulombic efficiency). Three electrolyte systems (MgCl2-AlCl3, MgCl2-AlPh3, and MgCl2-AlEtCl2) were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR (H-1, Al-27{H-1} and Mg-25{H-1}) spectroscopies and electrochemical analysis. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR studies consistently established molecular structures of the three electrolytes sharing a common Mg2+-dimer mono-cation, [(mu-Cl)(3)Mg-2(THF)(6)](+), along with an anion (AlCl4-, AlPh3Cl- and AlEtCl3- respectively). Clean and dendrite free Mg bulk plating and viable battery performance were validated through representative studies using the MgCl2-AlEtCl2 electrolyte. The reaction mechanism of MgCl2 and the Al Lewis acids in THF is discussed to highlight the formation of the electrochemically active [(mu-Cl)(3)Mg-2(THF)(6)](+) dimer mono-cation in these electrolytes and their improved performance compared to reported electrolytes using nucleophilic Mg2+ sources.",16
"The last 10 years established the beginning of a post-lithium era in the field of energy storage, with the renaissance of Na-ion batteries (NIBs) as alternative for Li-based systems. The development of this technology has required intense work in materials research in order to produce and optimize anodes, cathodes, and electrolytes for NIBs. The strong and weak points of the main families of compounds for each battery component are analyzed in this progress report. Taking into account the achievements made in materials for NIBs, the industrial scene is analyzed through the existing prototypes and commercial cells and also from an economical viewpoint. In this scenario, where Na-ion technology seems to be ready for a coming second generation, the use of Na can be extended to almost the whole spectrum of electrochemical energy storage systems: the new room temperature Na–S systems, high-energy Na–air technology, or high-power Na-based hybrid supercapacitors. Thus, the degree of development of NIBs, together with the promising performance of newer Na-based energy storage systems, makes Na the key to the coming commercial post-lithium systems.",8
"Among the existing energy storage technologies, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have unmatched energy density and versatility. From the time of their first commercialization in 1991, the growth in LIBs has been driven by portable devices. In recent years, however, large-scale electric vehicle and stationary applications have emerged. Because LIB raw material deposits are unevenly distributed and prone to price fluctuations, these large-scale applications have put unprecedented pressure on the LIB value chain, resulting in the need for alternative energy storage chemistries. The sodium-ion battery (SIB) chemistry is one of the most promising “beyond-lithium” energy storage technologies. Herein, the prospects and key challenges for the commercialization of SIBs are discussed. By comparing the technological evolutions of both LIBs and SIBs, key differences between the two battery chemistries are unraveled. Based on outstanding results in power, cyclability, and safety, the path toward SIB commercialization is seen imminent.",8
"Research on electrochemical Na intercalation in battery system has been reported since the early 1980s but Na-ion batteries are not commercialized so far though studies on Li-ion batteries have been reported since the late 1970s and the practical batteries have been extensively utilized for portable device applications in the world since 1991. Now, targeted application of research and development for rechargeable batteries has changed toward realization of the sustainable energy society. With the change in social situation and development of the battery technology, studies on Na-ion batteries have been attracted significant interests since 2010. Although research interests of the electrode materials for Na-ion batteries are evoked in many researchers, advantages, disadvantages, and issues are not fully discussed for realizing the commercialization of Na-ion batteries. In this article, practical issues and perspective are reviewed on the basis of mainly our experimental experiences, know-how, and results, and the future direction is proposed to overcome the issues and to challenge the advanced performance.",8
"Energy production and storage have become key issues concerning our welfare in daily life. Present challenges for batteries are twofold. In the first place, the increasing demand for powering systems of portable electronic devices and zero-emission vehicles stimulates research towards high energy and high voltage systems. In the second place, low cost batteries are required in order to advance towards smart electric grids that integrate discontinuous energy flow from renewable sources, optimizing the performance of clean energy sources. Na-ion batteries can be the key for the second point, because of the huge availability of sodium, its low price and the similarity of both Li and Na insertion chemistries. In spite of the lower energy density and voltage of Na-ion based technologies, they can be focused on applications where the weight and footprint requirement is less drastic, such as electrical grid storage. Much work has to be done in the field of Na-ion in order to catch up with Li-ion technology. Cathodic and anodic materials must be optimized, and new electrolytes will be the key point for Na-ion success. This review will gather the up-to-date knowledge about Na-ion battery materials, with the aim of providing a wide view of the systems that have already been explored and a starting point for the new research on this battery technology.",8
"The Na-ion-batteries are considered much attention for the next-generation power-sources due to the high abundance of Na resources that lower the cost and become the alternative for the state of the art Li-ion batteries in future. In this review, the recently reported potential cathode and anode candidates for Na-ion-batteries are identified in-light-of-their high-performance for the development of Na-ion-full-cells. Further, the recent-progress on the Na-ion full-cells including the strategies used to improve the high cycling-performance (stable even up-to 50000 cycles), operating voltage (even ≥ 3.7 V), capacity (>350 mAhg−1 even at 1000 mAg−1 (based-on-mass-of-the-anode)), and energy density (even up-to 400 Whkg−1) are reviewed. In addition, Na-ion-batteries with the electrodes containing reduced graphene oxide, and the recent developments on symmetric Na-ion-batteries are discussed. Further, this paper identifies the promising Na-ion-batteries including the strategies used to assemble full-cell using hard-carbon-anodes, Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes, and other-electrode-materials. Then, comparison between aqueous and non-aqueous Na-ion-batteries in terms of voltage and energy density has been given. Later, various types of electrolytes used for Na-ion-batteries including aqueous, non-aqueous, ionic-liquids and solid-state electrolytes are discussed. Finally, commercial and technological-developments on Na-ion-batteries are provided. The scientific and engineering knowledge gained on Na-ion-batteries afford conceivable development for practical application in near future.",8
"More than 170 nations have signed The Paris Agreement so far, committing to fight climate change by cutting carbon emissions with the proposal of “carbon peak and neutrality” goals. Rechargeable batteries, as the representative technologies of energy storage, play a key role for decarbonization. After 30 years of development, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have already walked into thousands of families, making it possible to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. (1) Due to the restriction of limited Li resources, a series of “beyond LIBs” research has sprung up all over the batteries field. However, most of it is still in the conceptual stage. Fortunately, Na-ion batteries (NIBs), which most closely resemble the technology of LIBs, have the greatest potential to achieve industrialization. (2–5) The development of NIBs is driven by the rapid growth of renewable energies such as solar and wind energy, which require large-scale energy storage systems. NIBs have been considered as a good choice due to the abundance and wide distribution of Na, and more unexpected properties of the material or system level of NIBs are being revealed with intensive in-depth studies, (6) including wide working temperature range, fast charge/discharge, high safety, etc. Recently, the start-up company HiNa launched their first 1 MWh NIB system for energy storage (Figure 1), which is a milestone of NIB development. CATL (a leading manufacturer of LIBs) recently announced their first-generation NIB technology, which attracted unprecedented attention. (7) At this critical moment, this Editorial aims to present some insights on the commercialization of NIBs.",8
"Several emerging battery technologies are currently on endeavour to take a share of the dominant position taken by Li-ion batteries in the field of energy storage. Among them, sodium-based batteries offer a combination of attractive properties i.e., low cost, sustainable precursors and secure raw material supplies. Na-based batteries include related battery concepts, such as Na-ion, all solid-state Na batteries, Na/O2 and Na/S, that differ in key components and in redox chemistry, and therefore result in separate challenges and metrics. Na-ion batteries represent an attractive solution which is almost ready to challenge Li-ion technology in certain applications; the other cell concepts represent a more disruptive innovation, with a higher performance gain, provided that major hurdles are overcome. The present review aims at highlighting the most promising materials in the field of Na-based batteries and challenges needed to be addressed to make this technology industrially appealing, by providing an in-depth analysis of performance metrics from recent literature. To this end, half-cell reported metrics have been extrapolated to full cell level for the more mature Na-ion technology to provide a fair comparison with existing technologies.",8
"Li and Na batteries are very important as energy storage devices for electric vehicles and smart grids. It is well known that, when an electrode is analysed in detail, each of the components (the active material, the conductive carbon, the current collector and the binder) makes a portion of contribution to the battery performance in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, cycle life, etc. However, there has not yet been a review on the binder, though there are already many review papers on the active materials. Binders make up only a small part of the electrode composition, but in some cases, they play an important role in affecting the cycling stability and rate capability for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) has been the mainstream binder, but there have been discoveries that aqueous binders can sometimes make a battery perform better, not to mention they are cheaper, greener, and easier to use for electrode fabrication. In this review, we focus on several kinds of promising electrode materials, to show how their battery performance can be affected significantly by binder materials: anode materials such as Si, Sn and transitional metal oxides; cathode materials such as LiFePO4, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiCoO2 and sulphur.",8
"Rechargeable lithium batteries have risen to prominence as key devices for green and sustainable energy development. Electric vehicles, which are not equipped with an internal combustion engine, have been launched in the market. Manganese- and iron-based positive-electrode materials1,2, such as LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4, are used in large-scale batteries for electric vehicles. Manganese and iron are abundant elements in the Earth’s crust, but lithium is not. In contrast to lithium, sodium is an attractive charge carrier on the basis of elemental abundance. Recently, some layered materials3,4,5,6, where sodium can be electrochemically and reversibly extracted/inserted, have been reported. However, their reversible capacity is typically limited to 100 mAh g−1. Herein, we report a new electrode material, P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2, that delivers 190 mAh g−1 of reversible capacity in the sodium cells with the electrochemically active Fe3+/Fe4+ redox. These results will contribute to the development of rechargeable batteries from the earth-abundant elements operable at room temperature.",8
"Following the prevalence of the Li-ion battery for electrical energy storage systems (EESs), the world is looking toward alternative, cost-effective, electrical EESs for portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage from renewable sources. Na-based batteries are the most promising candidates and show similar chemistry as Li-based batteries. All-solid-state sodium batteries (AS3Bs) have attracted great attention due to safe operation, high energy density, and wide operational temperature. Herein, current development of solid-state crystalline borate- and chalcogenide-based Na-ion conductors is discussed together with historically important Na-β-alumina and Na superionic conductors (NASICONs). Furthermore, we report on engineering a ceramic Na-ion electrolyte and electrode interface, which is considered a bottleneck for practical applications of solid-state electrolytes in AS3Bs. A soft Na-ion conducting interlayer is critical to suppress the interfacial Na-ion charge transfer resistance between the solid electrolyte and electrode. Several Na-ion conducting ionic liquids, polymers, gels, crystalline plastics interlayers, and other interfacial modification strategies have been effectively employed in advanced AS3Bs.",8
"We discuss the similarities and dissimilarities of sodium- and lithium-ion batteries in terms of negative and positive electrodes. Compared to the comprehensive body of work on lithium-ion batteries, research on sodium-ion batteries is still at the germination stage. Since both sodium and lithium are alkali metals, they share similar chemical properties including ionicity, electronegativity and electrochemical reactivity. They accordingly have comparable synthetic protocols and electrochemical performances, which indicates that sodium-ion batteries can be successfully developed based on previously applied approaches or methods in the lithium counterpart. The electrode materials in Li-ion batteries provide the best library for research on Na-ion batteries because many Na-ion insertion hosts have their roots in Li-ion insertion hosts. However, the larger size and different bonding characteristics of sodium ions influence the thermodynamic and/or kinetic properties of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to unexpected behaviour in electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, compared to lithium-ion batteries. This perspective provides a comparative overview of the major developments in the area of positive and negative electrode materials in both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries in the past decade. Highlighted are concepts in solid state chemistry and electrochemistry that have provided new opportunities for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",8
"Research interest in Na-ion batteries has increased rapidly because of the environmental friendliness of sodium compared to lithium. Throughout this Perspective paper, we report and review recent scientific advances in the field of negative electrode materials used for Na-ion batteries. This paper sheds light on negative electrode materials for Na-ion batteries: carbonaceous materials, oxides/phosphates (as sodium insertion materials), sodium alloy/compounds and so on. These electrode materials have different reaction mechanisms for electrochemical sodiation/desodiation processes. Moreover, not only sodiation-active materials but also binders, current collectors, electrolytes and electrode/electrolyte interphase and its stabilization are essential for long cycle life Na-ion batteries. This paper also addresses the prospect of Na-ion batteries as low-cost and long-life batteries with relatively high-energy density as their potential competitive edge over the commercialized Li-ion batteries.",8
"Carbon-coated Na2FePO4F is synthesized by a simple solid-state method with ascorbic acid as carbon source. Structural characterization of Na2FePO4F by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy reveals that ascorbic acid effectively suppresses the particle growth of Na2FePO4F, forming the nano-sized carbon coated materials. Electrode performance of Na2FePO4F for rechargeable sodium batteries is also examined. The carbon-coated Na2FePO4F sample (1.3 wt% carbon) delivers initial discharge capacity of 110 mAh g-1 at a rate of 1/20 C (6.2 mA g-1) with well-defined voltage plateaus at 3.06 and 2.91 V vs. Na metal. The sample also shows acceptable capacity retention and rate capability as the positive electrode materials for rechargeable Na batteries, which is operable at room temperature.",8
"For more than 20 years, most of the technological achievements for the realization of positive electrodes for practical rechargeable Li battery systems have been devoted to transition metal oxides such as LixMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Mn), LixMn2O4, LixV2O5, or LixV3O8. The first two classes of materials built on close-packed oxygen stacking adopt bidimensional and tridimensional crystal structures, respectively (Figure 1), from which lithium ions may be easily intercalated or extracted in a reversible manner. These oxides are reasonably good ionic and electronic conductors, and lithium insertion/extraction proceeds while operating on the M4+/M3+ redox couple, located between 4 and 5 V versus Li+/Li.",15
"The electrochemical properties of the P2-type NaxMn1/2Fe1/2O2 (x = 0.62) phase used as a positive electrode in Na batteries were tested in various voltage ranges at C/20. We show that, even if the highest capacity is obtained for the first cycles between 1.5 and 4.3 V, the best capacity after 50 cycles is obtained while cycling between 1.5 and 4.0 V (120 mAh g–1). The structural changes occurring in the material during the (de)intercalation were studied by operando in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and ex situ synchrotron XRPD. We show that a phase with an orthorhombic P′2-type structure is formed for x ≈ 1, due to the cooperative Jahn–Teller effect of the Mn3+ ions. P2 structure type stacking is observed for 0.35 < x < 0.82, while above 4.0 V, a new phase appears. A full indexation of the XRPD pattern of this latter phase was not possible because of the broadening of the diffraction peaks. However, a much shorter interslab distance was found that may imply a gliding of the MO2 slab occurring at high voltage. Raman spectroscopy was used as a local probe and showed that in this new phase the MO2 layers are maintained, but the phase exhibits a strong degree of disorder.",8
"Na-ion batteries have emerged in recent years, due to their advantages of natural abundance, low cost and environmental friendliness. In this article, we review the up-to-date research progress on anode materials for Na-ion batteries from five respects: carbon-based materials, alloy-based materials, metal oxides and sulfides based on conversion reaction, titanium-based compounds with insertion mechanism, and organic composites. In particular, we not only summarize the Na-storage mechanism of these anodes, but also discuss the failure mechanism. The problems and challenges associated with these anodes are pointed out. Furthermore, on the basis of extensive reports and our experimental studies, feasible strategies are suggested for designing high performance anode materials. After further in-depth exploration and investigation, we believe that Na-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for low cost and large-scale energy storage systems in the near future.",8
"In concern of resource sustainability and environmental friendliness, organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries have attracted increasing attentions in recent years. However, for many researchers, the primary impression on organic cathode materials is the poor cycling stability and low energy density, mainly due to the unfavorable dissolution and low redox potential, respectively. Herein, a novel polymer cathode material, namely poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) is reported, for either rechargeable Li or Na battery. Remarkably, PBQS shows a high energy density of 734 W h kg–1 (2.67 V × 275 mA h g–1) in Li battery, or 557 W h kg–1 (2.08 V × 268 mA h g–1) in Na battery, which exceeds those of most inorganic Li or Na intercalation cathodes. Moreover, PBQS also demonstrates excellent long-term cycling stability (1000 cycles, 86%) and superior rate capability (5000 mA g–1, 72%) in Li battery. Besides the exciting battery performance, investigations on the structure–property relationship between benzoquinone (BQ) and PBQS, and electrochemical behavior difference between Li–PBQS battery and Na–PBQS battery, also provide significant insights into developing better Li-organic and Na-organic batteries beyond conventional Li-ion batteries.",15
"Benefiting from a higher volumetric capacity (3833 mA h cm−3 for Mg vs. 2046 mA h cm−3 for Li) and dendrite-free Mg metal anode, reversible Mg batteries (RMBs) are a promising chemistry for applications beyond Li ion batteries. However, RMBs are still severely restricted by the absence of high performance cathodes for any practical application. In this review, we provide a critical and rigorous review of Mg battery cathode materials, mainly reported since 2013, focusing on the impact of structure and composition on magnesiation kinetics. We discuss cathode materials, including intercalation compounds, conversion materials (O2, S, organic compounds), water co-intercalation cathodes (V2O5, MnO2etc.), as well as hybrid systems using Mg metal anode. Among them, intercalation cathodes are further categorized by 3D (Chevrel phase, spinel structure etc.), 2D (layered structure), and 1D materials (polyanion: phosphate and silicate), according to the diffusion pathway of Mg2+ in the framework. Instead of discussing every published work in detail, this review selects the most representative works and highlights the merits and challenges of each class of cathodes. Advances in theoretical analysis are also reviewed and compared with experimental results. This critical review will provide comprehensive knowledge of Mg cathodes and guidelines for exploring new cathodes for rechargeable magnesium batteries.",10
"Energy storage is a vital issue to be solved for the efficient utilization of renewable energies such as solar, wind and tidal energy. In terms of rechargeable battery energy storage, magnesium has many advantages over lithium, such as low cost, environmental benignity and ease of operation. Therefore, rechargeable Mg batteries (RMBs) are considered as a promising green alternative to rechargeable lithium batteries for practical applications. Over the past few years, RMBs have made great progress, but there are also many problems. In this review, we summarize the latest developments of materials for RMBs from three main aspects: cathodes, electrolytes and anodes. The effects of cathode structures on Mg2+ ion migration kinetics are expounded; the properties and characteristics of various electrolytes for RMBs are briefly described; and the modification of metallic Mg and other types of anode materials are discussed comprehensively. In addition, the current challenges and several important guidelines for future progress of development of RMBs are also discussed.",10
"The first working Mg rechargeable battery prototypes were ready for presentation about 13 years ago after two breakthroughs. The first was the development of non-Grignard Mg complex electrolyte solutions with reasonably wide electrochemical windows in which Mg electrodes are fully reversible. The second breakthrough was attained by demonstrating high-rate Mg cathodes based on Chevrel phases. These prototypes could compete with lead–acid or Ni–Cd batteries in terms of energy density, very low self-discharge, a wide temperature range of operation, and an impressive prolonged cycle life. However, the energy density and rate capability of these Mg battery prototypes were not attractive enough to commercialize them. Since then we have seen gradual progress in the development of better electrolyte solutions, as well as suggestions of new cathodes. In this article we review the recent accumulated experience, understandings, new strategies and materials, in the continuous R&D process of non-aqueous Mg batteries. This paper provides a road-map of this field during the last decade.",10
"The thermodynamic properties of magnesium make it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable batteries, because it may provide a considerably higher energy density than the commonly used lead–acid and nickel–cadmium systems. Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction1,2,3. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts4. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions1,5, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes6,7, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.",10
"Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as promising candidates for post-lithium energy storage systems (ESSs). For addressing the critical issues in the current liquid AIB systems, here a flexible solid-state AIB is established using a gel-polymer electrolyte for achieving robust electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Different from utilization of solid-state systems for alleviating the safety issues and enhancing energy density in lithium-ion batteries, employment of polymeric electrolytes mainly focuses on addressing the essential problems in the liquid AIBs, including unstable internal interfaces induced by mechanical deformation and production of gases as well as unfavorable separators. Particularly, such gel electrolyte enables the solid-state AIBs to present an ultra-fast charge capability within 10 s at current density of 600 mA g−1. Meanwhile, an impressive specific capacity ≈120 mA h g−1 is obtained at current density of 60 mA g−1, approaching the theoretical limit of graphite-based AIBs. In addition to the well-retained electrochemical performance below the ice point, the solid-state AIBs also hold great stability and safety under various critical conditions. The results suggest that such new prototype of solid-state AIBs with robust electrode–electrolyte interfaces promises a novel strategy for fabricating stable and safe flexible ESSs.",4
"Over the last decade, optimizing energy storage has become significantly important in the field of energy conversion and sustainability. As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.",4
"A critical overview of the latest developments in the aluminum battery technologies is reported. The substitution of lithium with alternative metal anodes characterized by lower cost and higher abundance is nowadays one of the most widely explored paths to reduce the cost of electrochemical storage systems and enable long-term sustainability. Aluminum based secondary batteries could be a viable alternative to the present Li-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity (8040 mAh cm−3 for Al vs 2046 mAh cm−3 for Li). Additionally, the low cost aluminum makes these batteries appealing for large-scale electrical energy storage. Here, we describe the evolution of the various aluminum systems, starting from those based on aqueous electrolytes to, in more details, those based on non-aqueous electrolytes. Particular attention has been dedicated to the latest development of electrolytic media characterized by low reactivity towards other cell components. The attention is then focused on electrode materials enabling the reversible aluminum intercalation-deintercalation process. Finally, we touch on the topic of high-capacity aluminum-sulfur batteries, attempting to forecast their chances to reach the status of practical energy storage systems.",4
"Aluminum–air (Al–air) batteries, both primary and secondary, are promising candidates for their use as electric batteries to power electric and electronic devices, utility and commercial vehicles and other usages at a relatively lower cost. This paper provides an analysis of the performance of these batteries with a component by component comparison with other technologies. It also aims to identify the major impediments that must be overcome for the battery. Al alloys are inexpensive and provide better electrochemical performances as compared to pure Al. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is traditionally controlled by platinum and other noble catalysts, but several carbonaceous materials, transitional metal oxides, and polymer-based systems may be satisfactory alternatives. The aqueous alkali electrolytes, though widely used at present, may be suitably replaced by non-aqueous electrolytes, aprotic and ionic liquids for both primary and secondary batteries. The different types of design and assembly for greater performance and economic viability are also described. This review may serve as a scientific tool for the progression of research on Al–air battery system.",16
"The ever-growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid-scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum-based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium-ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al. However, the anode problems in primary and secondary Al batteries, such as, self-corrosion, passive film, and volume expansion, severely limit the batteries’ practical performance, thus hindering their commercialization. Herein, an overview of the currently emerged Al-based batteries is provided, that primarily focus on the recent research progress for Al anodes in both primary and rechargeable systems. The anode reaction mechanisms and problems in various Al-based batteries are discussed, and various strategies to overcome the challenges of Al anodes, including surface oxidation, self-corrosion, volume expansion, and dendrite growth, are systematically summarized. Finally, future research perspectives toward advanced Al batteries with higher performance and better safety are presented.",4
"Aluminum batteries are considered compelling electrochemical energy storage systems because of the natural abundance of aluminum, the high charge storage capacity of aluminum of 2980 mA h g−1/8046 mA h cm−3, and the sufficiently low redox potential of Al3+/Al. Several electrochemical storage technologies based on aluminum have been proposed so far. This review classifies the types of reported Al-batteries into two main groups: aqueous (Al-ion, and Al-air) and non-aqueous (aluminum graphite dual-ion, Al-organic dual-ion, Al-ion, and Al-sulfur). Specific focus is given to Al electrolyte chemistry based on chloroaluminate melts, deep eutectic solvents, polymers, and “chlorine-free” formulations.",4
"The concept of exploring the superior benefits of electropositive metals as anodes in rechargeable metal-batteries has resurfaced in recent times in anticipation of the future societal need for high energy density and affordable batteries. A rechargeable battery based on aluminium chemistry is envisioned to be a low cost energy storage platform, considering that aluminium is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. The high volumetric capacity of aluminium, which is four and seven times larger than that of lithium and sodium respectively, unarguably has the potential to boost the energy density of aluminium-batteries on a per unit volume basis. Efforts to develop rechargeable aluminium-batteries can be traced to as early as the 1970s, however this area of research has seen a surge in activity since 2010, when the possibility of achieving an ambient temperature aluminium system was convincingly demonstrated. In recent times, rechargeable aluminium-batteries have been rechristened as aluminium-ion batteries. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the developments regarding rechargeable non-aqueous aluminium-batteries or aluminium-ion batteries. Additionally, the challenges that impede progress in achieving a practical aluminium-ion battery are also discussed.",4
"Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is the most promising cathode for next-generation lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries due to the much improved stability. However, the molecular structure and reaction mechanism have not yet been fully understood. Herein, we present a new take on the structure and mechanism to interpret the electrochemical behaviors. We find that the thiyl radical is generated after the cleavage of the S–S bond in molecules in the first cycle, and then a conjugative structure can be formed due to electron delocalization of the thiyl radical on the pyridine backbone. The conjugative structure can react with lithium ions through a lithium coupled electron transfer process and form an ion-coordination bond reversibly. This could be the real reason for the superior lithium storage capability, in which the lithium polysulfide may not be formed. This study refreshes current knowledge of SPAN in Li–S batteries. In addition, the structural analysis is applicable to analyze the current organic cathodes in rechargeable batteries and also allows further applications in Al–S batteries to achieve high performance.",15
"In the fast-evolving civilization of the twenty-first century, low-cost rechargeable batteries with high energy density (Ed) and overall performance are emerging as a technology of crucial importance. It is critically essential to advance new battery materials and electrochemical chemistry beyond traditional Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in order to significantly increase the Ed to satisfy the escalating demands. Aluminum (Al) is promising options for primary/secondary aluminum batteries (ABs) because of their large volumetric capacity (Cυ ∼8.04 A h cm−3, four times higher than Li), abundancy (∼8.2%), low price ($ ∼2.20 USD kg−1), and environmental friendliness. The low-capacity electrode materials, rapid capacity decay, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) due to corrosion of Al anode, lack of cost-effective and moisture-resistant electrolytes, and stable current collectors are just a few of the ABs limitations that need to be surpass before they can be used in commercialization. This work comprehensively reviews recent advances, mechanisms, and future prospects in primary/secondary ABs, covering types, structure, electrochemistry, recent developments in cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and separators, results achieved, challenges, and future prospects.",4
"The Al–air battery possesses high theoretical specific energy (4140 W h/kg) and is therefore an attractive candidate for vehicle propulsion. However, the experimentally observed open-circuit potential is much lower than what bulk thermodynamics predicts, and this potential loss is typically attributed to corrosion. Similarly, large Tafel slopes associated with the battery are assumed to be due to film formation. We present a detailed thermodynamic study of the Al–air battery using density functional theory. The results suggest that the maximum open-circuit potential of the Al anode is only −1.87 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode at pH 14.6 instead of the traditionally assumed −2.34 V and that large Tafel slopes are inherent in the electrochemistry. These deviations from the bulk thermodynamics are intrinsic to the electrochemical surface processes that define Al anodic dissolution. This has contributions from both asymmetry in multielectron transfers and, more importantly, a large chemical stabilization inherent to the formation of bulk Al(OH)3 from surface intermediates. These are fundamental limitations that cannot be improved even if corrosion and film effects are completely suppressed.",16
"Aluminium alloys containing small additions of both tin (∼0.1 wt%) and gallium (∼0.05 wt%) are shown to dissolve anodically at high rates in sodium chloride media at room temperatures; current densities >0.2 A cm−2 can be obtained at potentials close to the open circuit potential, ∼−1500 mV versus SCE. The tin exists in the alloys as a second phase, typically as ∼1 μm inclusions (precipitates) distributed throughout the aluminium structure, and anodic dissolution occurs to form pits around the tin inclusions. Although the distribution of the gallium in the alloy could not be established, it is also shown to be critical in the formation of these pits as well as maintaining their activity. The stability of the alloys to open circuit corrosion and the overpotential for high rate dissolution, both critical to battery performance, are shown to depend on factors in addition to elemental composition; both heat treatment and mechanical working influence the performance of the alloy. The correlation between alloy performance and their microstructure has been investigated.",16
"Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as viable alternatives to lithium-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity, their low cost, and the rich abundance of aluminum. However, several serious drawbacks of aqueous systems (passive film formation, hydrogen evolution, anode corrosion, etc.) hinder the large-scale application of these systems. Thus, nonaqueous AIBs show incomparable advantages for progress in large-scale electrical energy storage. However, nonaqueous aluminum battery systems are still nascent, and various technical and scientific obstacles to designing AIBs with high capacity and long cycling life have not been resolved until now. Moreover, the aluminum cell is a complex device whose energy density is determined by various parameters, most of which are often ignored, resulting in failure to achieve the maximum performance of the cell. The purpose here is to discuss how to further develop reliable nonaqueous AIBs. First, the current status of nonaqueous AIBs is reviewed based on statistical data from the literature. The influence of parameters on energy density is analyzed, and the current situation and existing problems are summarized. Furthermore, possible solutions and concerns regarding the construction of reliable nonaqueous AIBs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, future research directions and prospects in the aluminum battery field are proposed.",5
"Aluminum (Al) is an innovative anode material for metal-air batteries. But high corrosion rates and large polarization interfere with its commercial application. In the study reported in this paper, an ultrafine-grained (UFG) aluminum anode was prepared by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) at room temperature. The electrochemical properties of the Al anode were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization in 4 mol L−1 NaOH, KOH and 2 mol L−1 NaCl. Battery performance using the anodes was tested by constant current discharge at 10 mA cm−2 in the referenced electrolytes. The experimental results showed that finer grain sizes enhance battery performance in alkaline electrolytes, due to active dissolution of the Al anode. But in the NaCl electrolyte, the fine grain size of the Al anode offers no performance due to the blockage of the oxide film and local corrosion. This anode fabrication approach provides a means for improving the performance Al-air battery in alkaline electrolytes.",16
"In this paper, the performance of Al-air batteries based on pure Al, Al–0.1 wt%Ga, Al–0.1 wt%In and Al–0.1 wt%Sn anodes in 1 M KOH solutions was investigated by galvanostatic discharge test. The electrochemical characteristics of the anodes were investigated by means of hydrogen collection, tafel polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results reveal that compared with pure Al in 1 M KOH, Al–0.1 wt%In or Al–0.1 wt%Sn exhibits a lower self-corrosion rate and higher electrochemical activity because indium or tin with a high hydrogen evolution overpotential deposits on the aluminum surface. The Al–0.1 wt%Ga alloy is not an ideal anode of alkaline Al-air battery because the severe self-corrosion. The results of galvanostatic discharge at a current density from 1 to 40 mA cm−2 indicate that the Al-air batteries based on both Al–0.1 wt%In and Al–0.1 wt%Sn anodes in 1 M KOH show excellent discharge performance and high anodic efficiencies.",16
"A novel type of perfluorinated ionomer with lithium sulfonyl dicyanomethide functional groups was prepared for Li-ion batteries with high rate performance. The immobile sulfonyl dicyanomethide anion on the backbone of the polymer chain results in the unity transference number of Li+ and high ionic conductivity of the ionomer electrolyte, which could prevent problems caused by a concentration gradient in the electrolyte. F-19 NMR and FT-IR confirmed that the polymer was synthesized successfully. With the appropriate solvent, the ionomer electrolyte's ionic conductivities were observed to be as high as 10(-4) S cm(-1) at room temperature. The ionomer electrolyte was electrochemically stable up to 4.5 V, and it still had a stable interface with the Li electrode after a long storage time. The ionomer electrolyte has a promising future in practical application for lithium-ion batteries.",10
"Lithium salts possess dissociating properties that are useful for passivation layer formation. In this study, these properties are investigated in the context of three kinds of linear carbonate electrolytes using several techniques, such as physical properties, AC impedance, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The lithium salts are completely dissociated to the lithium ions by the unsymmetrical linear carbonate structure; therefore, the transference number and diffusion coefficient of the cations show that the lithium ions are important and dominate the ionic transfer and the passivation layer properties that are important and relate to battery performance. These data suggest that battery performance is influenced by ionic transfer properties, lithium salt and electrolyte structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10
"The growth of sodium dendrites and the associated solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is a critical and fundamental issue influencing the safety and cycling lifespan of sodium batteries. In this work, we use in-situ(23)Na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, along with an innovative analytical approach, to provide space-resolved and quantitative insights into the formation and evolution of sodium metal microstructures (SMSs; that is, dendritic and mossy Na metal) during the deposition and stripping processes. Our results reveal that the growing SMSs give rise to a linear increase in the overpotential until a transition voltage of 0.15 V is reached, at which point violent electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte is triggered, leading to the formation of mossy-type SMSs and rapid battery failure. In addition, we determined the existence of NaH in the SEI on sodium metal with ex-situ NMR results. The poor electronic conductivity of NaH is beneficial for the growth of a stable SEI on sodium metal.Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy provide quantitative insights into the growth of sodium microstructures in batteries.",0
"Six electrolytes were investigated for lithium metal battery applications. The electrolytes were composed of combinations Of four different salts (LiPF6, LiB(C2O4)(2). Lil and LiN(SO2CF3)(2)) and three different solvents (PC, DME, and 1,3-dioxolane). All six electrolytes had conductivities >3 mScm(-1) at temperatures from -20 to 40 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear polarization, both at room temperature and low temperature (-8 degrees C), provided congruent results. The Lil-based electrolyte had the lowest him resistance. while 0.7 M LiB(C2O4)(2)-PC:DME (1:1) had the highest impedance, The presence of 1,3-dioxolane in electrolytes provided lower impedance with LiB(C2O4)(2) but higher resistance with LiPF6-based electrolytes. NMR analysis of electrolytes after thermal abuse indicate that LiN(SO2CF3)(2)-based electrolytes are the most thermally stable.

"Anthraquinone-based molecules are promising electroactive materials for use in aqueous organic flow batteries. At high concentrations in aqueous solutions, the well-known negolyte molecule anthraquinone disulfonic acid (AQDS) molecule has been observed to aggregate under near-neutral and acidic conditions. Aggregation has been hypothesized to be directly linked to observed concurrent capacity reduction. In this study, we investigated three different water-soluble anthraquinones in electrolytes of varying compositions and pH to gain further insight into the possible causes of capacity loss. We used low-field benchtop 1H-NMR and diffusion NMR measurements directly in non-deuterated aqueous flow-battery electrolytes to investigate molecular aggregation. Single-cell testing was performed under exhaustive electrolysis conditions to determine the number of electrons exchanged per molecule. We observed a decrease in the number of electrons exchanged per molecule in the presence of carbonate ions due to CO2 adduct formation. The aggregation constants were determined from both concentration-dependent chemical shifts and self-diffusion coefficients. We show that aggregation of the oxidized form of all three molecules studied here occurs under near-neutral and alkaline conditions and does not affect the number of accessible e-.",10
"The Li+ transference numbers of three different liquid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries were measured in a symmetrical Li I electrolyte I Li cell by means of very-low-frequency impedance spectroscopy (VLF-IS). The electrolytes were: (i) The standard battery electrolyte LP30; (ii) an equimolar mixture of tetraglyme (G4) and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI); (iii) Li-TFSI dissolved in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMP-TFSI). We found that the Li+ transference numbers of the two electrolytes LP30 and G4/Li-TFSI are much smaller than the Li+ transport numbers t(Li+)(NMR) obtained from pulsed-field gradient NMR measurements. On the other hand, in the case of BMP-TFSI/Li-TFSI, the values for t(Li+)(current) and t(Li+)(NMR) are more similar. In order to rationalize the large differences between t(Li+)(current) and t(Li+)(NMR) found for LP30 and G4/Li-TFSI, we combined the Onsager reciprocal relations with linear response theory, and we derived expressions for t(Li+)(current) which take into account all correlations between ionic movements in the electrolyte. Thereby, we show that t(Li+)(current) can be considerably smaller than t(Li+)(NMR) if strong directional correlations exist between the movements of cations and anions. Finally, we discuss differences in Li+ transference numbers obtained by VLF-IS and by potentiostatic polarization measurements. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.",10
"Electrochemical cells based on a V2O5 composite cathode, aluminum anode, and AlCl3 + 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid electrolyte were prepared and characterized to ascertain the role of V2O5. The V2O5 was found to be electrochemically inactive in a potential window of 5 mV to 1.5 V vs. Al/Al3+. The electrochemical behavior of the cells was found to be independent of the V2O5 and depend entirely on the stainless steel used as a current collector, thus showing stainless steel and V2O5 to be of limited use in this electrolyte.",4
"The excessive emission of CO2 and the energy crisis are two major issues facing humanity. Thus, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and its utilization in metal–CO2 batteries have attracted wide attention because the batteries can simultaneously accelerate CO2 fixation/utilization and energy storage/release. Here, rechargeable Al–CO2 batteries are proposed and realized, which use chemically stable Al as the anode. The batteries display small discharge/charge voltage gaps down to 0.091 V and high energy efficiencies up to 87.7%, indicating an efficient battery performance. Their chemical reaction mechanism to produce the performance is revealed to be 4Al + 9CO2 ↔ 2Al2(CO3)3 + 3C, by which CO2 is reversibly utilized. These batteries are envisaged to effectively and safely serve as a potential CO2 fixation/utilization strategy with stable Al.",4
"In this work, pure Al, Al–Sn, Al–Mg, and Al–Mg–Sn alloys have been investigated as anodes for aluminum-air batteries. Effects of Mg and Sn additions on the aluminum anodes for Al-air battery in 4 mol L−1 KOH solution have been evaluated by self-corrosion test, open circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cell voltage and galvanostatic discharge as well as ab-initio energy calculation based on density functional theory. The results show that Al alloy anodes show better corrosion resistance and battery performance than the pure Al anodes. The self-corrosion rate of Al alloys increase in the following order: Al > Al–Sn > Al–Mg–Sn > Al–Mg. The Al–Mg alloy shows the smallest self-corrosion rate and largest capacity among the three Al alloy anodes. The Al–Mg–Sn alloy has the best electrochemical performance and battery discharge performance. SEM, EDS and 3D measuring laser microscope analysis of Al alloys are in good agreement with the self-corrosion test and electrochemical characteristics. Furthermore, the ab-initio energy calculation also reveals the positive role of alloying elements in enhancing corrosion and electrochemical performances.",16
"The aluminum–air battery is an attractive candidate as a metal–air battery because of its high theoretical electrochemical equivalent value, 2.98 A h g−1, which is higher than those of other active metals, such as magnesium (2.20 A h g−1) and zinc (0.82 A h g−1). This paper provides an overview of recently developed materials for aluminum–air batteries to be used in various elements, including the anode, air cathode and electrolyte. Aluminum can be alloyed with other active metal elements such as Tin (Sn), Indium (In), Gallium (Ga) and Zinc (Zn). Its binary and tertiary alloys demonstrate improved battery performance. Bifunctional air cathodes fabricated using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, CoO/N-CNT with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, Ni–Fe-layered double hydroxide/CNT and MnO2/N-CNT yield excellent results. With regard to electrolytes, several types have been considered: aqueous, non-aqueous, aprotic solvent and solid-state electrolytes. The addition of corrosion inhibitors to an aqueous electrolyte helps to enhance battery performance, whereas non-aqueous and aprotic solvent electrolytes can be used to prevent hydrogen evolution. Polymer electrolytes can overcome the battery leakage problem. As a conclusion, the future research trends related to this type of battery have also been indicated.",16
"Aqueous aluminum batteries are promising post-lithium battery technologies for large-scale energy storage applications because of the raw materials abundance, low costs, safety and high theoretical capacity. However, their development is hindered by the unsatisfactory electrochemical behaviour of the Al metal electrode due to the presence of an oxide layer and hydrogen side reaction. To circumvent these issues, we report aluminum-copper alloy lamellar heterostructures as anode active materials. These alloys improve the Al-ion electrochemical reversibility (e.g., achieving dendrite-free Al deposition during stripping/plating cycles) by using periodic galvanic couplings of alternating anodic α-aluminum and cathodic intermetallic Al2Cu nanometric lamellas. In symmetric cell configuration with a low oxygen concentration (i.e., 0.13 mg L−1) aqueous electrolyte solution, the lamella-nanostructured eutectic Al82Cu18 alloy electrode allows Al stripping/plating for 2000 h with an overpotential lower than ±53 mV. When the Al82Cu18 anode is tested in combination with an AlxMnO2 cathode material, the aqueous full cell delivers specific energy of ~670 Wh kg−1 at 100 mA g−1 and an initial discharge capacity of ~400 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 83% after 400 cycles.",9
"Aluminum metal is a high-energy-density carrier with low cost, and thus endows rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) with the potential to act as an inexpensive and efficient electrochemical device, so as to supplement the increasing demand for energy storage and conversion. Despite the enticing aspects regarding cost and energy density, the poor reversibility of electrodes has limited the pursuit of RABs for a long time. Fortunately, ionic-liquid electrolytes enable reversible aluminum plating/stripping at room temperature, and they lay the very foundation of RABs. In order to integrate with the aluminum-metal anode, the selection of the cathode is pivotal, but is limited at present. The scant option of a reliable cathode can be accounted for by the intrinsic high charge density of Al3+ ions, which results in sluggish diffusion. Hence, reliable cathode materials are a key challenge of burgeoning RABs. Herein, the main focus is on the insertion cathodes for RABs also termed aluminum-ion batteries, and the recent progress and optimization methods are summarized. Finally, an outlook is presented to navigate the possible future work.",5
"Aluminum–air (Al–air) battery is one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems because of its high capacity and energy density, and abundance. The polyacrylic acid (PAA)-based alkaline gel electrolyte is used in all-solid-state Al–air batteries instead of aqueous electrolytes to prevent leakage. The optimal gel electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 460 mS cm−1, which is close to that of aqueous electrolytes.

"Sulfur is an important electrode material in metal−sulfur batteries. It is usually coupled with metal anodes and undergoes electrochemical reduction to form metal sulfides. Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the reversible sulfur oxidation process in AlCl3/carbamide ionic liquid, where sulfur is electrochemically oxidized by AlCl4− to form AlSCl7. The sulfur oxidation is: 1) highly reversible with an efficiency of ~94%; and 2) workable within a wide range of high potentials. As a result, the Al−S battery based on sulfur oxidation can be cycled steadily around ~1.8 V, which is the highest operation voltage in Al−S batteries. The study of sulfur oxidation process benefits the understanding of sulfur chemistry and provides a valuable inspiration for the design of other high-voltage metal−sulfur batteries, not limited to Al−S configurations.",7
"Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) have been a promising energy storage technology beyond lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) benefiting from the high volumetric capacity and low cost of Al metal anode.

In order to provide a systematic understanding of research process and prospect of AIBs, we make an overview on the recent progress and optimization methods of cathode materials with different energy storage mechanisms, and the key advances in the engineering of electrolytes. Moreover, the future research perspectives and the key challenges ahead for designing high-performance AIBs are also presented.",5

"High theoretical energy densities of metal battery anode materials have motivated research in this area for several decades. Aluminum in an Al-air battery (AAB) is attractive due to its light weight, wide availability at low cost, and safety. Electrochemical equivalence of aluminum allows for higher charge transfer per ion compared to lithium and other monovalent ions. However, significant challenges have impeded progress towards commercialization, including formation of an aluminum hydroxide surface barrier, high aluminum corrosion rate, and self-discharge susceptibility. Addition of alloying elements is a widely used technique for mitigating these problems in aqueous electrolytes. A number of alloying elements have been evaluated, with typical characteristics such as higher nobility than aluminum, and high overpotential for hydrogen evolution. Over time, a large number of studies have examined alloys across a broad landscape of components and composition in aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes. This manuscript first takes a broader look at metal-air battery performance before focusing on a summary of data and electrochemical performance for aluminum and aluminum alloys of indium, tin, and/or gallium, and surveys proposed mechanisms driving surface chemistry in alkaline electrolytes on aluminum alloy anodes comprising these materials. AAB performance of ionic liquid and solid-state electrolytes with aluminum anodes is also considered, as results to date support the idea that these designs have the potential to minimize corrosion and enable secondary capability for applications requiring rechargeability.",16
"The increasing global demand for energy and the potential environmental impact of increased energy consumption require greener, safer, and more cost-efficient energy storage technologies. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been successful in meeting much of today’s energy storage demand; however, lithium (Li) is a costly metal, is unevenly distributed around the world, and poses serious safety and environmental concerns. Alternate battery technologies should thus be developed. Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have recently attracted attention due to their safety, environmental friendliness, and lower cost, compared to LIBs. They use aqueous electrolytes, which give them an advantage over multivalent ion batteries (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+) that require more complex electrolytes. However, as with every new technology, many fundamental and practical challenges must be overcome for ZIBs to become commercial products. In this manuscript, we present a timely review and offer perspectives on recent developments and future directions in ZIBs research.

"Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have recently attracted attention for applications in energy storage systems owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, environmental compatibility, and competitive gravimetric energy density. To enable the practical applications of ZIBs, their energy density must be equivalent to the existing commercial lithium-ion batteries. To acquire high-energy density, increasing the operating voltage of the battery is undoubtedly an effective method, which demands cathode material to exhibit a high voltage versus Zn2+/Zn, while matching a highly reversible anode and an electrolyte with a sufficiently wide electrochemical stability window.

"Rechargeable magnesium ion batteries are interesting as one of the alternative metal ion battery systems to lithium ion batteries due to the wide availability and accessibility of magnesium in the earth's crust. On the one hand, electrolyte solutions in which Mg metal anodes are fully reversible are not suitable for the use of high voltage/high capacity transition metal oxide cathodes due to complex surface phenomena. On the other hand, Mg metal anodes cannot work reversibly in conventional electrolyte solutions in which high voltage/high capacity Mg insertion cathodes can work because of passivation phenomena that fully block them. Replacing Mg metal with alternative anodes that can work reversibly in conventional electrolyte solutions could provide a promising route to elaborate high voltage and high capacity rechargeable Mg battery systems. Herein, the recent progress in alloy anodes based on group IIIA, IVA, VA elements is summarized.

"Nonaqueous rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries suffer from the complicated and moisture-sensitive electrolyte chemistry. Besides electrolytes, the practicality of a Mg battery is also confined by the absence of high-performance electrode materials due to the intrinsically slow Mg2+ diffusion in the solids. In this work, we demonstrated a rechargeable aqueous magnesium ion battery (AMIB) concept of high energy density, fast kinetics, and reversibility. Using a superconcentration approach we expanded the electrochemical stability window of the aqueous electrolyte to 2.0 V.

More importantly, two new Mg ion host materials, Li3V2(PO4)3 and poly pyromellitic dianhydride, were developed and employed as cathode and anode electrodes, respectively. Based on comparisons of the aqueous and nonaqueous systems, the role of water is identified to be critical in the Mg ion mobility in the intercalation host but remaining little detrimental to its non-diffusion controlled process. Compared with the previously reported Mg ion cell delivers an unprecedented high power density of 6400 W kg ion cell delivers an unprecedented high power density of 6400 W kg while retaining 92% of the initial capacity after 6000 cycles, pushing the Mg ion cell to a brand new stage.",11

Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21 mol kg(-1) in water to up to 60 mol kg(-1) in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium-ion battery with an energy density of 150 Wh kg(-1) on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.",0
"Developing high-voltage Mg-compatible electrolytes (>3.0V vs Mg) still remains to be the biggest R&D challenge in the area of nonaqueous rechargeable Mg batteries. Here, the key design concepts toward exploring new boron-based Mg salts in a specific way of highlighting the implications of anions are proposed for the first time. The well-defined boron-centered anion-based magnesium electrolyte (BCM electrolyte) is successfully presented by facile one-step mixing of tris(2H-hexafluoroisopropyl) borate and MgF2 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane, in which the structures of anions have been thoroughly investigated via mass spectrometry accompanied by NMR and Raman spectra. The first all-round practical BCM electrolyte fulfills all requirements of easy synthesis, high ionic conductivity, wide potential window (3.5 V vs Mg), compatibility with electrophilic sulfur, and simultaneously noncorrosivity to coin cell assemblies. When utilizing the BCM electrolyte, the fast-kinetics selenium/carbon (Se/C) cathode achieves the best rate capability and the sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode exhibits an impressive prolonged cycle life than previously published reports. The BCM electrolyte offers the most promising avenue to eliminate the major roadblocks on the way to high-voltage Mg batteries and the design concepts can shed light on future exploration directions toward high-voltage Mg-compatible electrolytes.",6
"The present study deals with an investigation of two novel imidazolium ionic liquids bearing ether-ether (1O2O2-Im-2O1) or ether-siloxane (1O2O2-Im-1SiOSi) functionalities with TFSI anion and their mixtures with propylene carbonate as electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries. The electrochemical stability and conductivity of these novel ILs were analyzed by electrochemical studies, such as cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and impedance measurements. The applicability of these ILs as electrolytes in Li-ion batteries was studied in the presence of a high concentration of LiTFSI (1 mol kg(-1) electrolyte) and the ether-ether IL was shown to possess a high electrochemical stability window (ESW) of 5.9 V and good conductivity of 2.2 mS cm(-1). The electrochemical stability and conductivity were further complimented by self-diffusion of different ions using pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR, viscosity and thermal properties like TGA and DSC analysis. More importantly, we explored the effect of temperature on the electrochemical stability and conductivity of these ILs by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",6
"Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) is investigated as an acid scavenger to remove the acidic impurities in a commercial lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) carbonate electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of Li metal batteries. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements reveal the detailed reaction mechanisms of P2O5 with the LiPF6 electrolyte and its impurities, which removes hydrogen fluoride (HF) and difluor-ophosphoric acid (HPO2F2) and produces phosphorus oxyfluoride (POF3), OF2P-O-PF(5)( - )anions, and ethyl difluorophosphate (C2H5OPOF2) as new electrolyte species. The P2O5-modified LiPF(6 )electrolyte is chemically compatible with a Li metal anode and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) cathode, generating a POxFy- rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that leads to highly reversible Li electrodeposition, while eliminating transition metal dissolution and cathode particle cracking. The excellent electrochemical properties of the P2O5-modified LiPF6 electrolytes are demonstrated on Li||NMC622 pouch cells with 0.4 Ah capacity, 50 mu m Li anode, 3 mAh cm(-2) NMC622 cathode, and 3 g Ah(-1) electrolyte/capacity ratio. The pouch cells can be galvanostatically cycled at C/ 3 for 230 cycles with 87.7% retention.",6
"The development of batteries based on alternatives to lithium is essential to sustaining the increasing global energy demand. Earth abundant, energy dense metal anodes with mixed multivalent ions (e.g., Mg/Al) are promising next-generation systems. A critical challenge, however, is the development of advanced electrolytes that are compatible with them. To achieve this target, a deeper understanding of their properties and conductivity mechanisms is needed. Herein, in a family of Al/Mg mixed metal ionic liquid-based electrolytes for secondary batteries, the ion-speciation, thermal behavior and long-range charge-migration processes is studied. It is revealed that the chemical compositions and temperature modulate the distribution of AlCl4- and Al2Cl(7)(-) species in the anionic nanoaggregates of materials. These modifications are responsible of the mobility of ions, which is studied in detail by means of broadband electrical spectroscopy and pulse-field-gradient NMR. Results yield a clear picture of the role of ion aggregates in the long-range charge-migration processes occurring in these electrolytes.",9
"Redox flow batteries based on aqueous electrolytes with organic active material (ORFB) have great potential for the development of environmentally safe and ecologically sustainable energy storage systems. To be competitive with the state-of-the-art vanadium redox flow battery, organic electrolytes must meet a whole range of requirements. We investigated different anthraquinone-based electrolytes, i.e. anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid, anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid (2,7-AQDS), anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, and 1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid (BQDS) with respect to their solubility in sulfuric acid, their electrical conductivity, and their viscosity. For this purpose, the influence of the concentration of sulfuric acid and the active species on the electrolyte properties was determined. Using NMR spectroscopy we analysed the thermal and electrochemical stability of 2,7-AQDS and BQDS electrolytes. The electrochemical stability was also monitored by cyclic voltammetry. Both methods have also indicated the absence of crossover phenomena. Furthermore, the influence of the electrolyte properties on the performance of the ORFB was investigated. Comparison with the vanadium electrolyte allowed us to estimate these kinds of requirements in order to develop a comparable all-organic flow battery.",9
"Lithium difluoro(axalato) borate (LiODFB) was synthesized in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solvent and purified by the method of solventing-out crystallization. The structure characterization of the purified LiODFB was performed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. The electrochemical properties of the cells using 1 mol/L LiPF6 and 1 mol/L LiODFB in ethylene carbonate (EC)/DMC were investigated, respectively. The results indicate that LiODFB can be reduced at about 1.5 V and form a robust protective solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film on the graphite surface in the first cycle. The graphite/ LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cells with LiODFB-based electrolyte have very good capacity retention at 55,. and show very good rate capability at 0.5C and 1C charge/discharge rate. Therefore, as a new salt, LiODFB is a most promising alternative lithium salt to replace LiPF6 for lithium ion battery electrolytes in the future.",9
"Graphite fluorides obtained by fluorination of graphite at room temperature and after a subsequent re-fluorination treatment were characterised by X-ray diffraction and F-19 MAS NMR. Their electrochemical performances as cathode materials in magnesium batteries have been investigated. Four different electrolytes (0.5 or 1 M Mg(ClO4)(2) in ACN, DMSO, PC and THF) were used for these tests. The specific energy and power densities were estimated for all media. A comparison of the performances between lithium and magnesium batteries was realised. The effect, on the electrochemical performances, of a re-fluorination treatment at 250 degrees C was also studied. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",9
"Batteries using aqueous electrolytes have gained significant attention for their safety, low cost, and carbon neutrality compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIB). Highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes, known as water-in-salt electrolytes (WISEs), have been extensively studied because of their ability to widen the electrochemical stability window (ESW) of the electrolyte to increase the battery voltage and allow the use of a light and low-cost aluminum current collector. However, WISEs generally suffer from salt crystallization caused by a slight temperature decrease to stop ion transportation in the electrolyte. This research shows that concentrated aqueous solutions of potassium pyrophosphate (K4P2O7) exhibit typical characteristics of a WISE while enabling the electrolyte to resist electrolyte freezing and salt crystallization. Furthermore, it was found that this electrolyte exhibits superionic conduction with a transference number of K+ exceeding 90%, which is close to that of solid electrolytes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman analysis indicate a strong interaction between the pyrophosphate ions and water molecules, in accordance with the weak Lewis acidity of K+. This unique electrolyte suggests other directions for research aimed at promoting the practical application of conventional concentrated aqueous solutions.",9
"To understand the limited cycle life performance and poor energy efficiency associated with rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries, the discharge products of primary Li-O-2 cells at different depths of discharge (DOD) were systematically analyzed using XRD, FTIR and Ultra-high field MAS NMR. When discharged to 2.0V, the reaction products of Li-O-2 cells include a small amount of Li2O2 along with Li2CO3 and RO-(C=O)-OLi in the alkyl carbonate-based electrolyte. However, regardless of the DOD, there is no Li2O detected in the discharge products in the alkyl-carbonate electrolyte. For the first time it was revealed that in an oxygen atmosphere the high surface area carbon significantly reduces the electrochemical operation window of the electrolyte, and leads to plating of insoluble Li salts on the electrode at the end of the charging process. Therefore, the impedance of the Li-O-2 cell continues to increase after each discharge and recharge process. After only a few cycles, the carbon air electrode is completely insulated by the accumulated Li salt terminating the cycling. Published by Elsevier B.V.",9
"Given the electrochemical modelling and control systems challenges facing lithium-ion batteries in extreme operating conditions, such as low temperature and high C-rate, it is important to understand the transport dynamics in a polarized cell with large electrolyte concentration gradients. To this end, a combination of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments and MRI experiments coupled with pulsed-field gradient NMR for diffusion measurements were performed on an in situ lithium-ion cell operating at a variety of temperatures and current densities. The aim was to quantify the electrolyte transport parameters with spatial resolution. Some progress was attained towards this aim, and the necessary framework for future studies along this direction was developed; however, it was determined that in order to accurately quantify the transference number, a very accurate measurement of the concentration gradient is necessary when the polarization is large. It was also observed that limiting current behavior in the electrolyte at low temperature arises as a consequence of diffusion limitation on the anodic side, rather than ion depletion on the cathodic side. The framework developed herein may be useful not only for electrochemical model validation, but potentially also comprehensive electrolyte transport characterization, should the identified experimental limitations be overcome.",0
"The interactions between the mobile ions and membrane substrate were investigated for lithium electrolyte solutions confined within the separator membrane in lithium batteries through NMR and electrochemical measurements as well as theoretical analyses. Fundamental dynamic properties such as ionic mobility, dissociation degree of the salt, and microviscosities of the ion, which are responsible for ionic mobility, were different for the electrolyte confined within the membranes compared with the corresponding values for the free electrolyte. We also found that the interactions between the ion and membrane substrate depend on the type of membrane. The results of this study suggest that the ionic mobility of the electrolyte in a lithium battery can be controlled by selecting separator membranes with suitable chemical or physical properties, which would be significant for improving the performance of the battery system.",0
"The presence of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) ion pairs in carbonate-based electrolyte solutions is widely accepted in the field of battery electrolyte research and is expected to affect solution transport properties. No existing techniques are capable of directly quantifying salt dissociation in these solutions. Previous publications by others have provided estimates of dissociation degrees using dilute solution theory and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PFG-NMR) measurements of self-diffusivity. However, the behavior of a concentrated electrolyte solution can deviate significantly from dilute solution theory predictions. This work, for the first time, instead uses Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell concentrated solution theory and the generalized Darken relation with PFG-NMR measurements to quantify the degrees of dissociation in electrolyte solutions (LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate, 1:1 by weight). At LiPF6 concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 1.5 M, the salt dissociation degree is found to range from 61% to 37%. Transport properties are then calculated through concentrated solution theory with corrections for these significant levels of ion pairing. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

"Silicon (Si), which can give a high capacity, is a potential next-generation anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), though there is a growing concern over the safety of Si-based batteries with higher energy density, where the reaction between the electrolytes and the charged electrodes can cause thermal issues. In our study, we developed an electrolyte additive which effectively improves the thermal stability of Si electrodes. Specifically, addition of 5 wt % (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) into a commercial carbonate-based electrolyte reduces the heat generation from the Si electrode significantly while not affecting its charge and discharge capacities. NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations suggest that APTES serves as a PF5/HF scavenger, stabilizing the electrolyte and suppressing its decomposition at a high temperature. At the same time, moisture in the electrolyte triggers the polymerization of APTES, forming a protective network covering the electrodes. Moreover, APTES improves thermal stability of the electrode by forming a SiO2-rich solid-electrolyte interphase on the surface of the Si particles. The knowledge of the decomposition mechanism between the electrolyte and electrode from this study allows us to design stable electrolyte systems for battery applications in the future.",13
"With the extensive research and development of renewable energy technologies, there is an increasing interest in developing metal-free carbons as a new class of bifunctional electrocatalysts for boosting the performance of metal–air batteries. Along with significant understanding of the electrocatalytic nature and the rapid development of techniques, the activities of carbon electrocatalysts are well-tailored by introducing particular dopants/defects and structure regulation. Herein, the recent advances regarding the rational design of carbon-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction are summarized, with a special focus on the bifunctional applications in Zn–air and Li–air batteries. Specifically, the atomic modulation strategies to regulate the electrocatalytic activities of carbons and structure modification are summarized to gain deep insights into bifunctional mechanisms and boost advanced Zn–air and Li–air batteries.

"With the rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible electronic devices (FEDs), the demand for flexible energy storage/conversion devices (ESCDs) has also increased. Rechargeable flexible metal-air batteries (MABs) are expected to be one of the most ideal ESCDs due to their high theoretical energy density, cost advantage, and strong deformation adaptability. With the improvement of the device design, material assemblies, and manufacturing technology, the research on the electrochemical performance of flexible MABs has made significant progress. However, achieving the high mechanical flexibility, high safety, and wearable comfortability required by FEDs while maintaining the high performance of flexible MABs are still a daunting challenge. In this review, flexible Zn-air and Li-air batteries are mainly exemplified to describe the most recent progress and challenges of flexible MABs. We start with an overview of the structure and configuration of the flexible MABs and discuss their impact on battery performance and function. Then it focuses on the research progress of flexible metal anodes, gel polymer electrolytes, and air cathodes. Finally, the main challenges and future research perspectives involving flexible MABs for FEDs are proposed.",16
"Lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries have been envisaged and pursued as the long-term successor to Li-ion batteries, due to the highest theoretical energy density among all known battery chemistries. However, their practical application is hindered by low energy efficiency, sluggish kinetics, and a reliance on catalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). In a superoxide battery, oxygen is also used as the cathodic active medium but is reduced only to superoxide (O2•–), the anion formed by adding an electron to a diatomic oxygen molecule. Therefore, O2/O2•– is a unique single-electron ORR/OER process. Since the introduction of K–O2 batteries by our group in 2013, superoxide batteries based on potassium superoxide (KO2) have attracted increasing interest as promising energy storage devices due to their significantly lower overpotentials and costs. We have selected potassium for building the superoxide battery because it is the lightest alkali metal cation to form the thermodynamically stable superoxide (KO2) product. This allows the battery to operate through the proposed facile one-electron redox process of O2/KO2. This strategy provides an elegant solution to the long-lasting kinetic challenge of ORR/OER in metal–oxygen batteries without using any electrocatalysts. Over the past five years, we have been focused on understanding the electrolyte chemistry, especially at the electrode/electrolyte interphase, and the electrolyte’s stability in the presence of potassium metal and superoxide. In this Account, we examine our advances and understanding of the chemistry in superoxide batteries, with an emphasis on our systematic investigation of K–O2 batteries. We first introduce the K metal anode electrochemistry and its corrosion induced by electrolyte decomposition and oxygen crossover. Tuning the electrolyte composition to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is demonstrated to alleviate electrolyte decomposition and O2 cross-talk. We also analyze the nucleation and growth of KO2 in the oxygen electrode, as well its long-term stability. The electrochemical growth of KO2 on the cathode is correlated with the rate performance and capacity. Increasing the surface area and reducing the O2 diffusion pathway are identified as critical strategies to improve the rate performance and capacity. Li–O2 and Na–O2 batteries are further compared with the K–O2 chemistry regarding their pros and cons. Because only KO2 is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, K–O2 batteries offer reversible cathode reactions over the long-term while the counterparts undergo disproportionation. The parasitic reactions due to the reactivity of superoxide are discussed. With the trace side products quantified, the overall superoxide electrochemistry is highly reversible with an extended shelf life. Lastly, potential anode substitutes for K–O2 batteries are reviewed, including the K3Sb alloy and liquid Na–K alloy. We conclude with perspectives on the future development of the K metal anode interface, as well as the electrolyte and cathode materials to enable improved reversibility and maximized power capability. We hope this Account promotes further endeavors into the development of the K–O2 chemistry and related material technologies for superoxide battery research.",16
"Metal–air batteries (MABs), which possess exceptionally high energy density and exhibit other ideal features such as low cost, environmental benignity and safety, are regarded as promising candidates for the next generation of power sources.

In the present work, different types of MABs are overviewed from the perspective of the metal electrodes. Most metal electrodes that have been studied in recent years are reviewed, among which Zn, Al, Mg and Fe are highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each system are presented, and recent advances that address challenges such as corrosion, passivation and dendrite growth are introduced.

"Polyether solvents are considered interesting and important candidates for Li-O-2 battery systems. Discharge of Li-O-2 battery systems forms Li oxides. Their mechanism of formation is complex. The stability of most relevant polar aprotic solvents toward these Li oxides is questionable. Specially high surface area carbon electrodes were developed for the present work In this study, several spectroscopic tools and in situ measurements using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) were employed to explore the discharge-charge processes and related side reactions in Li-O-2 battery systems containing electrolyte solutions based on triglyme/lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) electrolyte solutions.

"H-2 magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy was used, in conjunction with step potential electrochemical spectroscopy (SPES), to investigate the reduction and H-insertion mechanisms of gamma-MnO2 in primary zinc alkaline batteries. Three electrolytic manganese dioxides (EMDs) were discharged in a deuterated alkaline electrolyte: a commercial EMD, and two synthetic EMDs, one prepared in a static electrolyte, and the other in a deuterated static electrolyte. Five distinct discharge processes were observed in the SPES plots, which were assigned to reduction of MnO2 near defects (1.45 V), reduction of ramsdellite and pyrolusite domains (1.1-1.3 V), formation of ZnMn2O4 (1.05 V), and reduction of Mn(III) to Mn(II) (0.95 V). The H-2 signal intensities increase up to ca. 50% of discharge and then decrease on further discharge due to the growth of non-proton-containing oxides, such as Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and ZnMn2O4. The H-2 MAS NMR spectra of the 1.4 V discharged products of all gamma-MnO2 samples were dominated by an isotropic resonance at around 300 ppm, which is assigned to deuteron environments near defects (e.g., Mn-vacancy sites). The results were compared to those for three gamma-MnO2 model compounds with different levels of De Wolff disorder, P-r approximate to 0.25, 0.61, 0.99. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.",0
"The promise of high specific energies for Li-O-2 batteries has driven research toward the development of new compatible materials for this emerging technology. Obtained energies, however, fall short of the theoretical values partly due to parasitic chemistries arising from organic solvent decomposition during battery cycling. Electrolyte solvent and salt decomposition have also been identified as limiting factors for rechargeability of the battery. Although lithium trifluorosulfonamide (LiTFSI) dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) has been shown to be a promising solvent/electrolyte candidate for Li-O-2 batteries, significant challenges remain, namely minimizing decomposition of both the solvent and electrolyte salt during battery cycling. Herein, we provide spectroscopic labeling studies to identify the source of H-2 at high potentials during charge and propose a decomposition pathway for DME to lithium formate and acetate products at low potentials. NMR studies were preformed to show that DME decomposes to lithium formate and acetate in aqueous Li2O2, products which are also observed after D2O workups on cathodes after discharge. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) to elucidate a mechanistic pathway for DME decomposition that is based on processes. known organic oxidation",9
"Alkali metal salts with trifluoromethanesulfonimide anions ([N(SO2CF3)(SO2R)](-)) are intriguing electrolyte components for high-performance rechargeable batteries, owing to their good thermal, chemical, and electrochemical stability. (Chlorosulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (HN[(SO2Cl)(SO2CF3)], H[ClTFSI]) is a crucial precursor to access these important sulfonimide salts. In this work, the chemical properties of H[ClTFSI] in the presence of various kinds of tertiary amines are systematically investigated.

"The quantification of lithium ion battery electrolyte additives provides challenges in terms of methods and instrumentation. In this work, the detectability of the flame retardant additive tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphite (TTFPi) differs unusually when added to a standard electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) : dimethyl carbonate (DMC) 1 : 1 wt%) using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID).

NMR and IT-TOF (TM) MS measurements confirm the chemical stability of the TTFPi/standard electrolyte mixture and concentration dependent GC-MS and GC-FID experiments indicate a premature FID saturation limit for TTFPi in presence of standard electrolyte. The findings explain the counterintuitive absence of TTFPi for higher concentrations and provide important information for future sample preparation.",0
"In this work we analyzed the cathodic reactions of an important ionic liquid (IL) based electrolyte solution, namely lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/N-methyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (BMP) TFSI. In situ FTIR spectroscopy was used for the analysis of gaseous products of the electrochemical decomposition of this IL solution during cathodic polarization of lithium metal and graphite electrodes. The main volatile product of the reductive decomposition of the anion in these BMPTFSI solutions is trifluoromethane. BMP cations decompose to mixtures of tertiary amines and hydrocarbons. The composition of the products is influenced by the nature of the anode material. Graphite possesses a catalytic activity in the electroreduction process of BMP cations which occurs along with their intercalation into the graphite structure.

"Rechargeable zinc (Zn) metal batteries are attractive for use as electrochemical energy storage systems on a global scale because of the low cost, high energy density, inherent safety, and strategic resource security of Zn metal. However, at low temperatures, Zn batteries typically suffer from high electrolyte viscosity and unfavorable ion transport properties. Here, we studied reversible Zn electrodeposition in mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIm]TFSI) ionic liquid, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) organic solvent, and Zn(TFSI)(2) zinc salt.

"Negative electrodes for lithium-ion batteries containing a hard carbon with different binders were characterised by Li-7 NMR experiments. The spectra of unwashed lithiated electrodes, although different in profile and position at room temperature for the different binders used, exhibited a common feature at temperatures lower than 200 K, namely the presence of three signals, in addition to that of the electrolyte salt, similar whatever the electrode technology. They were assigned to covalently bonded, intercalated and pseudo-metallic lithium species, respectively. At room temperature, an exchange was observed between at least two of these signals; its characterisation is complicated by the paramagnetic nature of some of the components which induces a change in their position and width upon heating simultaneously with the exchange process.

"During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high-performance reversible Al3+ storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) suffer severely from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy-driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al-ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME-PBAs) host. By multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al3+ storage. Meanwhile, the co-occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M−N bond intensity, which is beneficial for constraining the phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME-PBA lattice parameters is only 1.2 %. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The findings highlight that, the entropy regulation strategy could uncover the isochronous constraint on both strain and phase transition for long-term reversible Al3+ storage, providing a promising design for advanced electrode materials for aqueous multivalent ions batteries.",9
"Rechargeable aluminum batteries (Al batteries) can potentially be safer, cheaper, and deliver higher energy densities than those of commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, due to the very high charge density of Al3+ cations and their strong interactions with the host lattice, very few cathode materials are known to be able to reversibly intercalate these ions. Herein, a rechargeable Al battery based on a two-dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide (V2CTx) MXene cathode is reported. The reversible intercalation of Al3+ cations between the MXene layers is suggested to be the mechanism for charge storage. It was found that the electrochemical performance could be significantly improved by converting multilayered V2CTx particles to few-layer sheets. With specific capacities of more than 300 mAh g–1 at high discharge rates and relatively high discharge potentials, V2CTx MXene electrodes show one of the best performances among the reported cathode materials for Al batteries. This study can lead to foundations for the development of high-capacity and high energy density rechargeable Al batteries by showcasing the potential of a large family of intercalation-type cathode materials based on MXenes.",4
"Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are amongst the most promising post-lithium energy storage systems (ESS) with a substantially higher specific volumetric capacity (8046 mA h cm−3), higher safety and lower cost. The development of such efficient and low cost ESSs is essential in order to meet the future energy storage demands of modern society. In recent years, a number of research articles have been reported on the evolution of cathode materials for RABs, which makes a critical review timely in order to provide inspiration for future research. This article highlights the cathode materials developed specifically for RABs, in detail, the development of carbon-based cathode materials, and then that of transition metal oxide (TMO), sulfide and chloride based cathode materials and then finally, a few other cathode materials are also discussed. Accordingly, future perspectives and opportunities are highlighted.",4
"Rechargeable batteries based on an abundant metal such as aluminum with a three-electron transfer per atom are promising for large-scale electrochemical energy storage. Aluminum can be handled in air, thus offering superior safety, easy fabrication, and low cost. However, the development of Al-ion batteries has been challenging due to the difficulties in identifying suitable cathode materials. This study presents the use of a highly open framework Mo2.5 +  y VO9 +  z as a cathode for Al-ion batteries. The open-tunnel oxide allows a facile diffusion of the guest species and provides sufficient redox centers to help redistribute the charge within the local host lattice during the multivalent-ion insertion, thus leading to good rate capability with a specific capacity among the highest reported in the literature for Al-based batteries. This study also presents the use of Mo2.5 +  y VO9 +  z as a model host to develop a novel ultrafast technique for chemical insertion of Al ions into host structures. The microwave-assisted method employing diethylene glycol and aluminum diacetate (Al(OH)(C2H3O2)2) can be performed in air in as little as 30 min, which is far superior to the traditional chemical insertion techniques involving moisture-sensitive organometallic reagents. The Al-inserted Al x Mo2.5 +  y VO9 +  z obtained by the microwave-assisted chemical insertion can be used in Al-based rechargeable batteries.",5
"Aluminum (Al) based rechargeable batteries offer the possibilities of safety, high energy density and low cost. Graphene with excellent mechanical properties and high electronic conductivity contributes to the excellent long-term cycle stability and superior rate performance, rendering it an attractive cathode material for Al batteries. However, the synthesis process of the high quality graphene, which is high energy consumption and complex, is not appropriate for the mass application of Al batteries. In this work, we presented a cost-effective and low-temperature (600 °C) synthesis of edge-rich graphene paper for the cathode of Al batteries. The edge-rich and interconnected design of graphene could effectively improve its performance in Al batteries. A reversible capacity as high as 128 mA h g−1 was achieved at 2000 mA g−1. It also displayed a superior cycling stability, displaying no capacity decay and a Coulombic efficiency higher than 99.2% after 20,000 cycles at even a high current density of 8000 mA g−1. Significantly, this novel cathode material would present a new opportunity for the practical application of Al batteries.",4
"Aluminum metal is a promising anode material for next generation rechargeable batteries owing to its abundance, potentially dendrite-free deposition, and high capacity. The rechargeable aluminum/sulfur (Al/S) battery is of great interest owing to its high energy density (1340 Wh kg−1) and low cost. However, Al/S chemistry suffers poor reversibility owing to the difficulty of oxidizing AlSx. Herein, we demonstrate the first reversible Al/S battery in ionic-liquid electrolyte with an activated carbon cloth/sulfur composite cathode. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic results suggest that sulfur undergoes a solid-state conversion reaction in the electrolyte. Kinetics analysis identifies that the slow solid-state sulfur conversion reaction causes large voltage hysteresis and limits the energy efficiency of the system.",7
"The discharge characteristics of aluminium in inhibited and uninhibited 4 M KOH at 50°C have been explored. The performance of pure aluminium as a fuel is compared with that for two leading alloy fuels that had been evaluated in our previous work, Alloy BDW (Al−1Mg−0.1In−0.2Mn) and Alloy 21 (Al−0.2Ga−0.1In−0.1Tl). The inhibitors employed in this study, SnO 2− 3 , In(OH)3, BiO 3− 3 , Ga(OH) − 4 , MnO 2− 4 , and binary combinations thereof, are either present in Alloys BDW and 21 or have been investigated previously (SnO 2− 3 ). We found that potassium manganate (K2MnO4) and Na2SnO3+In(OH)3 are effective inhibitor systems, particularly at high discharge rates (400 mA cm−2), but at low discharge rates only manganate offers a significant advantage in coulombic efficiency over the uninhibited solution. Alloy BDW exhibits a very low open circuit (standby) corrosion rate, but its coulombic efficiency under discharge, as determined by delineating the partial anodic and cathodic reactions, was found to be no better than that of aluminium in the same uninhibited solution. Alloy 21 was found to exhibit a comparable performance to Alloy BDW under open circuit conditions and a much higher coulombic efficiency at low discharge rates (100 mA cm−2), but the performance of this alloy under high discharge rate conditions was not determined. Alloy 21 has the significant disadvantage that it contains thallium.",4
"We report 1-(dimethylamino) pyrrole (PyDMA) as an electrolyte additive for high voltage lithium-ion batteries based on LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622)//Graphite with an upper cutoff voltage of 4.4 V. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling indicates that the unique structure of PyDMA could be effective in preventing the hydrolysis of LiPF6 in a carbonate electrolyte, mitigating issues related to HF formation. The calculations also indicated that the additive would oxidize at lower potentials than typical electrolyte solvents, which could lead to protective films at the cathode surface. These expectations were tested using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and extensive electrochemical characterization. NMR studies confirmed the superb dehydrating capability of PyDMA, which successfully prevents HF formation even at high water content. Addition of 0.5 wt% PyDMA resulted in improved capacity retention in full-cells, and also in lower levels of transition metal dissolution from the cathode. Incremental capacity (dQ/dV) analysis indicates that benefits of PyDMA at low concentration (0.5-1 wt%) are associated with decreased rates of Li+-trapping reactions, and that higher concentrations of the additive can lead to isolation of cathode domains. Our study indicates that PyDMA could be a promising electrolyte additive for high voltage lithium-ion batteries at a low concentration.",16
"The continuous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) accumulation has been blamed for the rapid capacity loss of carbon anodes in Na and K ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) electrolytes, but the understanding of the SEI composition and its formation chemistry remains incomplete. Here, we explain this SEI accumulation as the continuous production of organic species in solution-phase reactions. By comparing the NMR spectra of SEIs and model compounds we synthesized, alkali metal ethyl carbonate (MEC, M = Na or K), long-chain alkali metal ethylene carbonate (LCMEC, M = Na or K), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) oligomers with ethyl carbonate ending groups are identified in Na and K SEIs. These components can be continuously generated in a series of solution-phase nucleophilic reactions triggered by ethoxides. Compared with the Li SEI formation chemistry, the enhancement of the nucleophilicity of an intermediate should be the cause of continuous nucleophilic reactions in the Na and K cases.",4
"High Li+ transference number electrolytes have attracted recent interest as a means to improve the energy density and rate capabilities of current lithium ion batteries. Here the viscosity and transport properties of a sulfonated polysulfone/poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer that displays both high transference number and high conductivity when dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are investigated for the first time in a battery-relevant solvent of nearly equivalent dielectric constant: mixed ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The addition of a binary salt to each solution is investigated as a means to improve conductivity, and the diffusion coefficient of each species is tracked by pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR). Through the Li-7 NMR peak width and quantum chemistry calculations of the dissociation constant, it is shown that although the two solvent systems have nearly equivalent dielectric constants, the conductivity and transference number of the EC/DMC solutions are significantly lower as a result of poor dissociation of the sulfonate group on the polymer backbone. These results are the first study of polyelectrolyte properties in a battery-relevant solvent and clearly demonstrate the need to consider solvent properties other than the dielectric constant in the design of these electrolytes.",8
"The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) technology is the most promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to its high theoretical specific energy and steady progress for applications requiring lightweight batteries such as aviation or heavy electric vehicles. For these applications, however, the rate capability of Li-S cells requires significant improvement. Advanced electrolyte formulations in Li-S batteries enable new pathways for cell development and adjustment of all components. However, their rate capability at pouch cell level is often neither evaluated nor compared to state of the art (SOTA) LiTFSI/dimethoxyethane/dioxolane (LITFSI: lithium-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) electrolyte. Herein, the combination of the sparingly polysulfide (PS) solvating hexylmethylether/1,2-dimethoxyethane (HME/DME) electrolyte and highly conductive carbon nanotube Buckypaper (CNT-BP) with low porosity was evaluated in both coin and pouch cells and compared to dimethoxyethane/dioxolane reference electrolyte. An advanced sulfur transfer melt infiltration was employed for cathode production with CNT-BP. The Li+ ion coordination in the HME/DME electrolyte was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, ionic conductivity and viscosity was investigated for the pristine electrolyte and a polysulfide-statured solution. Both electrolytes, DME/DOL-1/1 (DOL: 1,3-dioxolane) and HME/DME-8/2, are then combined with CNT-BP and transferred to multi-layered pouch cells. This study reveals that the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte increases drastically over state of (dis)charge especially for DME/DOL electrolyte and lean electrolyte regime leading to a better rate capability for the sparingly polysulfide solvating electrolyte. The evaluation in prototype cells is an important step towards bespoke adaption of Li-S batteries for practical applications.",3
"Herein, a novel cellulose derivative has been synthesized and investigated as a nature-derived solid polymer electrolyte for lithium batteries. Cellulose is oxidized in a two-step process to dicarboxylic acid cellulose to allow for grafting low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (550 g mol(-1)) via Fischer-Speier esterification at the thus obtained carboxyl groups. The chemical structure of the synthesized materials is confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Incorporating lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as conducting salt and Nbutyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr(14)TFSI) ionic liquid as plasticizer results in the realization of an amorphous and solvent-free solid polymer electrolyte. These electrolyte membranes are characterized by high thermal and electrochemical stability and ionic conductivities of about 1x10(-5) S cm(-1) at 20 degrees C and 2.5x10(-4) S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, which enables very stable lithium stripping and plating for more than 800 h.",12
"Non-aqueous Mg-ion batteries offer a promising way to overcome safety, costs, and energy density limitations of state-of-the-art Li-ion battery technology. We present a rigorous analysis of the magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), one of the few electrolytes that can reversibly plate and strip Mg. We use ab initio calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations to interrogate the MACC electrolyte composition with the goal of addressing two urgent questions that have puzzled battery researchers: (i) the functional species of the electrolyte, and (ii) the complex equilibria regulating the MACC speciation after prolonged electrochemical cycling, a process termed as conditioning, and after prolonged inactivity, a process called aging. A general computational strategy to untangle the complex structure of electrolytes, ionic liquids and other liquid media is presented. The analysis of formation energies and grand-potential phase diagrams of Mg-Al-Cl-THF suggests that the MACC electrolyte bears a simple chemical structure with few simple constituents, namely the electro-active species MgCl+ and AlCl4- in equilibrium with MgCl2 and AlCl3. Knowledge of the stable species of the MACC electrolyte allows us to determine the most important equilibria occurring during electrochemical cycling. We observe that Al deposition is always preferred to Mg deposition, explaining why freshly synthesized MACC cannot operate and needs to undergo preparatory conditioning. Similarly, we suggest that aluminum displacement and depletion from the solution upon electrolyte resting (along with continuous MgCl2 regeneration) represents one of the causes of electrolyte aging. Finally, we compute the NMR shifts from shielding tensors of selected molecules and ions providing fingerprints to guide future experimental investigations.",3
"Ethylene carbonate (EC) is the most widely used electrolyte solvent in lithium ion batteries, but it fails to form a stable passivation layer on materials such as Si and Li metal, which will enable the long-term cycling of the next- generation high-capacity lithium ion batteries containing these anode materials. High concentrations of soluble degradation products are detected in the electrolyte after prolonged cycling, but the chemical structures of these species remain unclear. Here, we used 1D, 2D, and diffusion NMR techniques combined with mass spectrometry to analyze electrolyte-containing C-13-labeled EC, and we report on the formation of a series of linear oligomers consisting of ethylene oxide and carbonate fragments with methoxide end groups as the major soluble degradation products of EC. Oligomers with methoxide terminals are likely to have weak interaction toward the electrode; thus, they easily detach from the electrode and are unable to passivate the surface, which may explain the origin of the capacity fade for high-capacity Si-based or Li metal anodes.",0
"Ionic diffusion and mobility of carrier species of lithium electrolyte materials were measured using a newly developled technique of spectroscopy, pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR under direct electric field. Combining a developed theoretical model with the observed dynamic values, individually estimated. I static properties such as the dissociation degree of the salt and the interactive force between the ions and polar sites of the medium. This new approach was applied to design new types of electrolytes such as urea-containing polymer gel electrolytes and liquid crystal electrolytes, taking advantage of the chemical and physical characters of the polymer and liquid crystal medium, respectively. In addition, an evaluation method of the porous condition of separator membranes was proposed from the aspect of diffusion coefficient distribution associated with the pore size distribution.",0
"The performance of battery electrolytes depends on three independent transport properties: ionic conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and transference number. While rigorous experimental techniques for measuring conductivity and diffusion coefficients are well-established, popular techniques for measuring the transference number rely on the assumption of ideal solutions. We employ three independent techniques for measuring transference number, t(+), in mixtures of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) salt. Transference numbers obtained using the steady-state current method pioneered by Bruce and Vincent, t(+), SS, and those obtained by pulsed-field gradient NMR, t(+), NMR, are compared against a new approach detailed by Newman and coworkers, t(+), Ne, for a range of salt concentrations. The latter approach is rigorous and based on concentrated solution theory, while the other two approaches only yield the true transference number in ideal solutions. Not surprisingly, we find that t(+), SS and t(+), NMR are positive throughout the entire salt concentration range, and decrease monotonically with increasing salt concentration. In contrast, t(+), Ne has a non-monotonic dependence on salt concentration and is negative in the highly-concentrated regime. Our work implies that ion transport in PEO/LiTFSI electrolytes at high salt concentrations is dominated by the transport of ionic clusters. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

"This study was focused on the investigation of ion dynamics in halogen-free, hydrophobic, and hydrolytically stable phosphonium bis(salicylato) borate [P-4,P-4,P-4,P-8][BScB] ionic liquid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries. The structure and purity of the synthesized ionic liquid and lithium bis(salicylato) borate Li[BScB] salt were characterized using H-1, C-13, P-31, and B-11 NMR spectroscopy. The Li[BScB] salt was mixed with an ionic liquid at the concentrations ranging from 2.5 mol% to 20 mol%. The physicochemical properties of the resulting electrolytes were characterized using thermal analysis (TGA and DSC), electrical impedance spectroscopy, and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The apparent transfer numbers of the individual ions were calculated from the diffusion coefficients of the cation and anion as determined via the PFG NMR spectroscopy. NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopic techniques revealed dynamic interactions between the lithium cation and bis(salicylato) borate anion in the electrolytes. The ion-ion interactions were found to increase with the increasing concentration of the Li[BScB] salt, which resulted in ionic clustering at the concentrations higher than 15 mol% of Li salt in the ionic liquid.",9
"Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is an effective electrolyte additive that can significantly improve the cycling ability of silicon and other anode materials. However, the fundamental mechanism of this improvement is still not well understood. Based on the results obtained from Li-6 NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies, we propose a molecular-level mechanism for how FEC affects the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film: 1) FEC is reduced through the opening of the five-membered ring leading to the formation of lithium poly(vinyl carbonate), LiF, and some dimers; 2) the FEC-derived lithium poly(vinyl carbonate) enhances the stability of the SEI film. The proposed reduction mechanism opens a new path to explore new electrolyte additives that can improve the cycling stability of silicon-based electrodes.",0
"Battery fast charging is pivotal for broader acceptance of electric mobility. While demonstrated for lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO) anodes, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Recently, NMR T-1 relaxation time constants of Li-7 in the bulk of LTO were found to change if the surrounding electrolyte was altered. It was explained by interdiffusion of mobile lithium ions between the two phases, facilitated by unpinning of polarons from surface defects and leading to a pseudo capacitive effect that potentially influences fast charging. This effect is explored further by systematically varying the lithium salt concentration in an aprotic electrolyte in contact with LTO. Spectrally resolved Li-7 T-1 NMR relaxation times were used as a measure for bulk concentration changes of paramagnetic polaronic charges in LTO. Correlation of electrolyte concentration and Li-7 T-1 showed qualitatively different behavior above and below a salt concentration of about 5 mM, leading to a relaxation dispersion maximum in the LTO bulk. At intermediate concentrations, relaxation was consistent with a Li-7 exchange equilibrium between LTO and electrolyte. Upon contact of the two phases, yet without insertion into an electrochemical cell or applying an external potential, lithium ions redistributed between LTO bulk and liquid electrolyte. The results can be understood analogously to the distribution of mobile lithium ions between two phases separated by a Li+ permeable membrane. This is the first demonstration of such an equilibrium for non-faradaic lithium exchange at an interface between a solid ceramic electrode and a liquid electrolyte outside an electrochemical cell, substantiating our previous hypothesis of a polaronsupported mechanism. This study provides a basis for more quantitative (surface) defect engineering, which is key to optimize battery fast-charging properties.",0
"Rechargeable Mg batteries are one of the most investigated polyvalent-metal storage batteries owing to the increased safety associated with the nondendritic nature of Mg electrodeposition, high volumetric capacity, and low cost. To realize the commercial applications of Mg batteries, there are still a number of challenges remaining unsolved, in particular, the lack of halogen free Mg electrolytes, as the use of the halogens remains a major limiting factor to achieving high voltage cathodes. Work presented here introduces an innovative approach to prepare a halogen-free Mg-based electrolyte in a simple, nonsynthetic method that can plate and strip Mg reversibly. Results suggest that by introducing a secondary amine cosolvent the magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)(2)) salt can be easily dissolved into a wide array of polar but aprotic ether solvents. A systematic structural investigation of a representative Mg(TFSI)(2) electrolyte in the cosolvent systems with the secondary amine was performed using pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, single crystal diffraction analysis, and NMR. The experimental atomic scale understanding reveals an ion pair structure of Mg2+ coordinated with six oxygen donors from the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anions and the THE solvent located in the first solvation shell. The as-formed neutral ion pair structure acts as the active component for reversible Mg deposition. We believe this new route of preparing Mg electrolytes can extend the current understanding of Mg electrolyte functionality for rechargeable Mg batteries and offers more guidance for the future electrolyte design.",0
"The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a critical role in determining the performance of lithium metal batteries. Herein, the formation mechanisms of the SEI is investigated in electrolytes with two frequently adopted solvents: diethyl carbonate (DEC) and ethylene carbonate (EC). The dispersity of reaction products between Li and solvents are explored by H-1-NMR and first-principles calculations. Lithium ethylene carbonate (LEC), the reduction product of DEC, disperses in the electrolyte, while lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC), the reduction product of EC, cannot disperse in the electrolyte. First-principles calculations further prove that the low polymerization degree of (LEC)(n) leads to its good dispersity, while poly-LEDC macromolecules can remain on the Li surface acting as the stable SEI. This work not only clearly points out the formation mechanism of SEI, but also demonstrates the functional role of EC, which can provide novel insights for electrolyte design of advanced batteries.",16
"Li rechargeable cells made with structural arrangement Li/membrane/ LixV2O5 were examined under three states using NMR spectroscopy; these states are charged, discharged, and over-cycled. Li-7 NMR signals at chemical shifts of 0 ppm and around -20 ppm from the resonance frequency, which corresponds to the Li ions from the residual electrolyte at the cathode surface and inside the cathode material of LixV2O5, respectively, were obtained from LixV2O5 samples in both charged and discharged cells. From nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time (T-1) measurements, two components due to the Li ions in the electrode surface region and inside the bulk of LixV2O5 particles were obtained from charged cell. The V-51 NMR spectra were virtually identical for LixV2O5 from the charged and over-cycled cells; however the intensity of V-51 NMR signal from the discharged cell was significantly lower due to paramagnetic V+4 and V+3 species.",0
"Capacity retention in lithium metal batteries needs to be improved if they are to be commercially viable, the low cycling stability and Li corrosion during storage of lithium metal batteries being even more problematic when there is no excess lithium in the cell. Herein, we develop in situ NMR metrology to study anode-free lithium metal batteries where lithium is plated directly onto a bare copper current collector from a LiFePO4 cathode. The methodology allows inactive or dead lithium formation during plating and stripping of lithium in a full-cell lithium metal battery to be tracked: dead lithium and SEI formation can be quantified by NMR and their relative rates of formation are here compared in carbonate and ether-electrolytes. Little-to-no dead Li was observed when FEC is used as an additive. The bulk magnetic susceptibility effects arising from the paramagnetic lithium metal were used to distinguish between different surface coverages of lithium deposits. The amount of lithium metal was monitored during rest periods, and lithium metal dissolution (corrosion) was observed in all electrolytes, even during the periods when the battery is not in use, i.e., when no current is flowing, demonstrating that dissolution of lithium remains a critical issue for lithium metal batteries. The high rate of corrosion is attributed to SEI formation on both lithium metal and copper (and Cu+, Cu2+ reduction). Strategies to mitigate the corrosion are explored, the work demonstrating that both polymer coatings and the modification of the copper surface chemistry help to stabilize the lithium metal surface.",9
"Calculations and modeling have shown that replacing the traditional graphite anode with silicon can greatly improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, the large volume change of silicon particles and high reactivity of lithiated silicon when in contact with the electrolyte lead to rapid capacity fading during charging/discharging processes. In this report, we use specific lithium silicides (LS) as model compounds to systematically study the reaction between lithiated Si and different electrolyte solvents, which provides a powerful platform to deconvolute and evaluate the degradation of various organic solvents in contact with the active lithiated Si-electrode surface after lithiation. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) characterization results show that a cyclic carbonate such as ethylene carbonate is chemically less stable than a linear carbonate such as ethylmethyl carbonate, fluoroethylene carbonate, and triglyme as they are found to be more stable when mixed with LS model compounds. Guided by the experimental results, two ethylene carbonate (EC)-free electrolytes are studied, and the electrochemical results show improvements with graphite-free Si electrodes relative to the traditional ethylene-carbonate-based electrolytes. More importantly, the study contributes to our understanding of the significant fundamental chemical and electrochemical stability differences between silicon and traditional graphite lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes and suggests a focused development of electrolytes with specific chemical stability vs lithiated silicon which can passivate the surface more effectively.",16
"A novel [Mg-2(mu-Cl)(2)](2+) cation complex, which is highly active for reversible Mg electrodeposition, was identified for the first time in this work. This complex was found to be present in electrolytes formulated in dimethoxyethane (DME) through dehalodimerization of non-nucleophilic MgCl2 by reacting with either Mg salts (such as Mg(TFSI)(2), TFSI = bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonylimide) or Lewis acid salts (such as AlEtCl2 or AlCl3). The molecular structure of the cation complex was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and NMR. The electrolyte synthesis process was studied and rational approaches for formulating highly active electrolytes were proposed. Through control of the anions, electrolytes with an efficiency close to 100%, a wide electrochemical window (up to 3.5 V) and a high ionic conductivity (46 mS cm(-1)) were obtained. The understanding of electrolyte synthesis in DME developed in this work could bring significant opportunities for the rational formulation of electrolytes of the general formula [Mg-2(mu-Cl)(2)][anion] x for practical Mg batteries.",9
"Efforts to expand the technological capability of batteries have generated increased interest in divalent cationic systems. Electrolytes used for these electrochemical applications often incorporate cyclic ethers as electrolyte solvents; however, the detailed solvation environments within such systems are not well-understood. To foster insights into the solvation structures of such electrolytes, Ca(TFSI)(2) and Zn(TFSI)(2) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran were investigated through multi-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (O-17, Ca-43, and Zn-67 NMR) combined with quantum chemistry modeling of NMR chemical shifts. NMR provides spectroscopic fingerprints that readily couple with quantum chemistry to identify a set of most probable solvation structures based on the best agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally measured values of chemical shifts. The multi-nuclear approach significantly enhances confidence that the correct solvation structures are identified due to the required simultaneous agreement between theory and experiment for multiple nuclear spins. Furthermore, quantum chemistry modeling provides a comparison of the solvation cluster formation energetics, allowing further refinement of the preferred solvation structures. It is shown that a range of solvation structures coexist in most of these electrolytes, with significant molecular motion and dynamic exchange among the structures. This level of solvation diversity correlates with the solubility of the electrolyte, with Zn(TFSI)(2)/THF exhibiting the lowest degree of each. Comparisons of analogous Ca2+ and Zn2+ solvation structures reveal a significant cation size effect that is manifested in significantly reduced cation-solvent bond lengths and thus stronger solvent bonding for Zn2+ relative to Ca2+. The strength of this bonding is further reduced by methylation of the cyclic ether ring. Solvation shells containing anions are energetically preferred in all the studied electrolytes, leading to significant quantities of contact ion pairs and consequently neutrally charged dusters. It is likely that the transport and interfacial de-solvation/re-solvation properties of these electrolytes are directed by these anion interactions. These insights into the detailed solvation structures, cation size, and solvent effects, including the molecular dynamics, are fundamentally important for the rational design of electrolytes in multivalent battery electrolyte systems.",3
"Recently, we have developed a boron based electrolyte system with outstanding electrochemical performance, formed through the reaction of tri(3,5-dimethylphenyl)borane (Mes(3)B) and PhMgCl in THF, for rechargeable magnesium batteries. In this paper, the main components and equilibria of the unique boron based electrolyte solutions are identified by NMR, single-crystal XRD, etc. The results prove that the solutions contain various magnesium species, such as Mg2Cl3+, MgCl+, Ph2Mg and the tetracoordinated boron anion [Mes(3)BPh](-). Fluorescence spectra and Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate that the high anodic stability (ca. 3.5 V vs. Mg reference electrode (RE)) of the Mes(3)B-(PhMgCl)(2) electrolyte is attributed to the non-covalent interactions between the anion [Mes(3)BPh](-) and Ph2Mg. Furthermore, the air sensitivity of the boron based electrolyte and its electrochemical stability on the different current collectors are studied. Finally, the reversible electrochemical process of Mg intercalation into a Mo6S8 cathode confirms that the boron based electrolyte could be practically used in rechargeable Mg battery systems.",0
"A new small molecule gel electrolyte is developed by trapping an organic mixture of 1,3-dioxolane and dimethyl ether with lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI). The electrochemical properties of the resulting gel electrolyte are investigated. AC impedance spectroscopy reveals that the ionic conductivity of the as-prepared gel electrolyte containing 8.3 wt% small molecules displays a maximum value of 6.43 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature. The possible interaction between molecule and LiTFSI was investigated by the NMR spectra and a speculated transmission mechanism was also discussed. The sulfur cathode with the as-prepared small molecule gel electrolyte displays the initial discharge specific capacity of 1008 mAh g(-1) (0.1 C). The Li-S cells assembled with the as-prepared electrolyte membrane display an excellent cycle performance and coulombic efficiency. The electrolyte membrane played an important role in restraining the shuttle effect of polysulfides. These experimental results demonstrate the possibility and potential as new solid electrolyte for Li-S batteries to replace the traditional polymer gel electrolyte.",0
"Different graphite fluorides were prepared by three different synthesis ways: fluorination at room temperature, at 600 degrees C, and refluorination at 400 and 530 degrees C of a fluorinated graphite prepared at room temperature. All the samples have been characterized by F-19 MAS NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies. Their electrochemical performances as cathode materials in primary lithium batteries have been investigated at room temperature and at 60 degrees C and as a function of the current density. Ageing behavior has been also studied using some liquid electrolytes. Refluorinated sample at 400 degrees C exhibits the best performances because of both its good average discharge potential and its discharge capacity, i.e. 2.54 degrees C and 848 Ah kg(-1), respectively. For this sample, the best specific energy density and specific power density are 2149 Wh kg(-1) and 902 W kg(-1), respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",15
"Currently adding a suitable additive in the electrolyte is one of the most effective strategies to improve the electrochemical performance for a lithium-ion battery, especially under high temperature. In this work, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an electrolyte additive was introduced to improve the battery performance of LiFePO4 at 60 degrees C. The addition of DMF can effectively increase the specific capacity, cycling performance, and rate performance of batteries using LiFePO4 as cathode material. X-ray diffraction results reveal that for the electrode cycled in the electrolyte without additive, Fe2O3, FePO4, and other impurity peaks appear under high temperature. scanning electron microscopy/transmission electron microscopy results indicate that some deposits are generated on the electrode surface without additive under high temperature due to the decomposition of electrolyte in the reaction between electrolyte and electrode materials. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy/NMR/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrate that DMF as a lewis base can capture lewis acidic PF5 from the decomposition of LiPF6 as well as block the chain reaction of LiFePO4 with hydrogen fluoride, which alleviates the electrolyte decomposition and electrode dissolution at high temperature.",0
"High-energy-density CFx/Li batteries have attracted wide applications, but encountered poor environmental adaptability at high/low temperatures. Guided with unique electrolyte-involved reaction mechanism, propylene carbonate (PC)/methyl butyrate (MB) co-solvent formulation was optimized to tune the desolvation barrier and stability for wide temperature operation. Weak affinity of Li+-MB and unique solvation structure of electrolyte, which facilitated easy desolvation at both high rate and low temperature, were uncovered with theoretical calculations and spectra characterizations. Desolvation process from intermediate and percolation-type reaction were clearly revealed with in-situ FT-IR and ex-situ TEM. The synergistic effect of handy desolvation with fast kinetics at the interface enabled excellent rate performance (1C, 834 mAh g(-1)) at +25 degrees C and high capacity (240 mAh g(-1)) at low temperature of -70 degrees C. Simultaneously, the stability of electrolyte assisted to realize high-temperature tolerance up to +95 degrees C. The mechanism-guided electrolyte design offers deep understanding and novel strategy to improve CFx/Li batteries for wide temperature applications.",0
"We report two methods that use either NMR spectroscopy or direct magnetic susceptibility measurements for in situ (strictly online) determination of the state of charge of redox flow batteries. These methods are demonstrated on the inorganic, redox-active potassium ferro/ferri cyanide catholyte cycled against 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone as the anolyte in a full cell, and should be applicable to a wide range of redox couples, provided that the magnetization of the electrolyte solution depends on its oxidation state.",16
"The cyclic carbonates 4-(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 4-(triethylsilyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one and 4-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl]-1,3-dioxolan-2-one were synthesized via an environmentally friendly synthetic route and applied as electrolytes in lithium-ion battery half-cells. The synthesis was carried out by the catalyzed conversion of CO2 with epoxides using the nontoxic catalysts FeCl2 and tetra-n-butylammonium bromide. Investigations of the LiTFSI solutions with regards to ionic conductivity, viscosity and solvent-salt interaction by NMR spectroscopy reveal a structure-property relationship. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements indicate no decomposition of the silyl carbonates within the electrochemical window of commonly used electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The suitability of the compounds as battery electrolytes is shown by half-cell measurements with lithium iron phosphate. The 4-(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one solution not only exhibits the highest conductivity but also a high capacity with superior stability over more than 50 cycles.

"In lithium-sulfur batteries, cell design, specifically electrolyte design, has a key impact on the battery perfor-mance. Development of sulfolane based electrolytes may grant the use of more available lithium salts such as LiClO4, LiPF6 and LiBF4, which are typically not preferred in lithium-sulfur batteries due to their reactive anions. Herein, in order to assess the reactivity of lithium polysulfides with various dimensions (with different lengths of the polysulfide chain) towards the anions of lithium electrolyte salts, the cycling of lithium-sulfur cells with 1 M solutions of LiPF6, LiBF4, and LiClO4 in sulfolane is studied in a wide (1.5-2.8 V) and narrow (limited) voltage ranges, corresponding to the high-voltage (2.1-2.8 V) and low-voltage (2.3-1.5 V) plateaus on the discharge curves. It is shown that the electrochemical characteristics of lithium-sulfur cells with sulfolane based electro-lytes of lithium perchlorate and lithium hexafluorophosphate differ significantly from those for sulfolane elec-trolyte based on lithium tetrafluoroborate. We believe that these differences are due to the direct chemical interaction of lithium polysulfides with the BF4 anion, which is confirmed by chronopotentiometry, 7Li and 11B NMR spectra, UV-Vis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of sulfolane solutions of the studied lithium salts, saturated with lithium polysulfides.",16
"Rechargeable lithium air (Li–air) batteries, especially the non-aqueous type, are considered the most promising energy storage and conversion device candidates for use in future electric vehicle applications due to their ultrahigh energy density. The air cathode has been identified as a key factor affecting the overall performance of Li–air batteries. The current low level performance of air cathodes is the major challenge hindering commercial applications of Li–air batteries. In the past decade, a great many cathode materials, structures and fabrication processes have been developed and investigated with the goal of enhancing cathode performance. This paper reviews, the role of the cathode in non-aqueous Li–air batteries including the cathode reaction mechanisms and the properties and morphologies of cathode materials, followed by approaches to optimize cathode performance. The most recently published global progress and the main achievements in the field of Li–air batteries are also systematically and critically reviewed in terms of cathode materials, structures and fabrication processes, with the objective of providing some state-of-the-art information. Technical challenges are analyzed, and insights into future research directions for overcoming these development challenges of rechargeable non-aqueous Li–air battery cathodes are also identified in this review paper.",3
"Rechargeable lithium–air (O2) batteries have received much attention due to their extremely high theoretical energy densities, which far exceeds that of current lithium-ion batteries. The considerable high energy densities come from (i) pure metal lithium as anode and (ii) the cathode oxidant, oxygen, which comes from the surrounding air. However, there are still many scientific and technical challenges especially nanomaterial challenges to overcome before it turns into reality. In this review, the fundamental principles and understanding of the electrochemical reaction in the aprotic lithium–air batteries are first presented. We emphasized on the discussion of the nanomaterial's issues which prevent their practical implementation, including the material status and challenges from cathode, electrolyte, anode and other components. These problems will be discussed in detail and possible solutions are also suggested. Finally, we explore future research directions in the field of aprotic rechargeable lithium–air batteries.",3
"The Li–air battery has recently emerged as a potentially transformational energy storage technology for both transportation and stationary energy storage applications because of its very high specific energy; however, its practical application is currently limited by the poor power capability (low current density), poor cyclability, and low energy efficiency. All of these are largely determined by interfacial reactions on oxygen electrocatalysts in the air electrode. In this article, we review the fundamental understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis in nonaqueous electrolytes and the status and challenges of oxygen electrocatalysts and provide a perspective on new electrocatalysts' design and development.",3
"Researchers worldwide view the high theoretical specific energy of the lithium–air or lithium–oxygen battery as a promising path to a transformational energy-storage system for electric vehicles. Here, we present a self-consistent material-to-system analysis of the best-case mass, volume, and cost values for the nonaqueous lithium–oxygen battery and compare them with current and advanced lithium-based batteries using metal-oxide positive electrodes. Surprisingly, despite their high theoretical specific energy, lithium–oxygen systems were projected to achieve parity with other candidate chemistries as a result of the requirement to deliver and purify or to enclose the gaseous oxygen reactant. The theoretical specific energy, which leads to predictions of an order of magnitude improvement over a traditional lithium-ion battery, is shown to be an inadequate predictor of systems-level cost, volume, and mass. This analysis reveals the importance of system-level considerations and identifies the reversible lithium-metal negative electrode as a common, critical high-risk technology needed for batteries to reach long-term automotive objectives. Additionally, advanced lithium-ion technology was found to be a moderate risk pathway to achieve the majority of volume and cost reductions.",3
"Quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry have been combined to probe possible mechanisms and the kinetic overpotentials, responsible for discharge and charge in a Li–O2 battery, using C as the cathode and an electrolyte based on dimethoxyethane as the solvent. Previous spectroscopy experiments (X-ray diffraction, μRaman, IR, XPS) have shown that Li2O2 is the principle product formed during Li–O2 discharge using this electrolyte/cathode combination. At all discharge potentials and charge potentials <4.0 V, the observed electrochemistry is ∼2e–/O2 consumed or produced, also implying that Li2O2 is the dominant thermodynamically stable species formed and consumed in the electrochemistry. No evidence exists at any potential for formation of stable LiO2 (1e–/O2) or Li2O (4e–/O2) during discharge. At charging potentials >4.0 V, the electrochemistry requires significantly more than 2e–/O2, and we take this as evidence for electrolyte decomposition. We find that sequential concerted (Li+ + e–) ion transfers to/from adsorbed O2* and LiO2* to produce/consume Li2O2 is the mechanism that is most compatible with these experiments. The kinetic overpotentials are extremely low relative to aqueous O2 reduction and evolution, and this implies that in principle a discharge–charge Li–O2 cycle is possible with high voltaic efficiency (∼85%) if electrolyte and cathode stability issues are resolved.",3
"Fire-retardant electrolyte chemistries have attracted great attention given their potential to solve the grand challenges of alkali-ion batteries: safety, use of metallic anodes, and anodic stability. Whereas extensive analysis and correlations are drawn to explain their unusual electrochemical behavior, one essential property, their effects on redox potentials of battery components (redox potential shift) pervasively lack a strict description and quantification. Here we show that the strong solvation of lithium cations by organic phosphates, the widely used flame-retardant constituents, induces a negative redox potential shift by as much as 500 mV. We demonstrate that the redox potential shift is characteristic of Li-cation (de)solvation processes whereas it is negligible for other processes. This has important consequences for high energy hybrid battery concepts such as high voltage dual-ion graphite or organic batteries. These findings also shine a different light on the enhanced anodic stability of these nonconventional battery electrolyte formulations.",10
"The effect of the addition of an ionic liquid DEME center dot TFSI to an electrolyte solution of Mg(HMDS) 2-MgCl2 in THF was studied electrochemically and spectroscopically. Reversible magnesium deposition/dissolution was achieved with the DEME center dot TFSI-modified electrolyte. This electrolyte shows higher ionic conductivity, and a linear relationship was observed between the ionic conductivity and the concentration of DEME center dot TFSI in THF solution of Mg(HMDS) 2-MgCl2. Mg-Mo6S8 coin cells have also been successfully cycled using Mg(HMDS) 2-MgCl2 electrolyte with the addition of DEME center dot TFSI. Raman and NMR spectroscopy suggest that DEME center dot TFSI facilitates magnesium deposition/dissolution by improving ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

"Lithium-ion batteries have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, as they did for wireless communication. A judicious choice of the liquid electrolytes used in these systems is required to achieve a good balance among high-energy storage, long cycle life and stability, and fast charging. Ethyle:ne-carbonate (EC) and propylene-carbonate (PC) are popular electrolytes. However, to date, almost all molecular-dynamics simulations of these fluids rely on classical force fields, while a complete description of the functionality of Li-ion batteries will eventually require quantum mechanics. We perform accurate ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations of ethylene- and propylene-carbonate with LiPF6 at experimental concentrations to build solvation models which explain available neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results and to compute Li-ion solvation energies and diffusion constants. Our results suggest some similarities between the two liquids as well as some important differences. Simulations also provide useful insights into formation of solid-electrolyte interphases in the presence of electrodes in conventional Li-ion batteries.",0
"A non-nucleophilic Hauser base hexamethyldisilazide (HMDS) magnesium electrolyte possesses inherent properties required for a magnesium-sulfur battery. However, the development of full cell batteries using HMDSCl-based electrolytes is still hampered by a low coulombic efficiency. A new electrolyte formulation of non-nucleophilic HMDS magnesium containing bromide as a halide instead of chloride was obtained through a simple and straightforward synthesis route. The electrochemistry of magnesium was investigated through plating and stripping in three different HMDSBr-based electrolytes: Mg(HMDS)Br, Mg(HMDS)Br-BEt3, and Mg(HMDS)Br-AlEt3 dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. The different magnesium species present in the electrolytes were determined using NMR. Weak electron-withdrawing Lewis acids, BEt3 and AlEt3 were used intentionally and their impact was investigated. Contrary to expectation, the substitution of chloride by bromide does not drastically narrow the electrochemical stability window. HMDSBr-based electrolytes demonstrated long-term (1000 cycles) stable reversibility and highly efficient (approximate to 99 %) magnesium plating/tripping without a high ratio of bromide compared with the MgHMDSCl-based electrolytes. The aprotic electrolyte shows comparatively high anodic stability (approximate to 2.4 V vs. Mg/Mg2+) and high ionic conductivity of 1.16 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. Plating of magnesium with low overpotential (<188 mV) revealed a morphology dependence on the electrolyte type with a shiny metallic homogenous layer, suggesting a rational balance between the nucleation and growth process in HMDSBr-based electrolytes.",0
"The changes in electrolyte composition on the molecular level and the reaction mechanisms of electrolyte degradation upon thermal aging are monitored by quantitative NMR spectroscopy, revealing similar rates of degradation for pristine and already aged electrolytes. The data analysis is not in favor of an autocatalytic reaction mechanism based on OPF3 but rather indicates that the degradation of LiPF6 in carbonate based solvents proceeds via a complex sequence of linear'' reactions rather than a cyclic reaction pattern which is determined by the amount of water present in the samples. All investigated electrolytes are reasonably stable at temperatures of up to 60 degrees C in the presence of minor amounts or absence of water hence indicating that chemical instability of electrolyte components against water is decisive for degradation and an increase in temperature (thermal aging'') just accelerates the degradation impact of water.",10
"Superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes have shown promise as safe and high-voltage lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrolytes. However, the interplay of lithium-ion solvation structure and dynamics with fast Li-ion transport has not been elucidated yet. Here, we combine the ultrafast femtosecond mid-IR spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, pulsed-field gradient NMR, and molecular dynamics simulation for investigating the solvation structure and Li-ion transport mechanism in superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes. We found the existence of water molecules with vibrational and rotational properties very similar to those of bulk water, even at extremely high salt concentrations (28 m). Our experimental results show that the electrolytes have a heterogeneous solvation environment, and bulk-like water molecules promote fast Li-ion transport. We anticipate that the molecular understanding of the superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes obtained here would facilitate the design of solvation structures to overcome the limit of dilute LIB electrolytes.",0
"A gel polymer electrolyte based on a polymer host comprising cyclic carbonate and ethylene oxide (EO) moieties in the side chains and the liquid electrolyte 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) 1:1 is studied regarding ionic and intermolecular interactions. Raman and NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that apart from the solvents of the liquid electrolyte also the polymer host is interacting with lithium ions. However, these interactions seem to be limited to the EO side chains. No evidence was found for an involvement of the cyclic carbonate moieties in the coordination of lithium ions. To evaluate the effect of the interactions between the lithium ions and the polymer network on the lithium-ion transport properties in the gel polymer electrolyte self-diffusion coefficients of the solvents, cation and anion were determined by pulsed field gradient (PFG)-NMR spectroscopy.",10
"Synthesis of complex magnesium cations in ethereal solutions, is receiving a lot of attention due to their potential utilization in rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB). The simplest complex cation, namely, solvated MgCl+, was hypothesized and reported as the most important cation in nonaqueous magnesium electrolyte solutions chemistry. However, such ions have never been isolated as the only cationic species in ethereal solutions developed for RMB. In this study, we report on successful isolation of the pure electrolyte MgCl(THF)5+- PhAlCl3, and on the electrochemical behavior of it in ethereal solutions. The structure of this compound was proved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman, and NMR spectroscopies. The novel MgCl(THF)5PhAlCl3/THF electrolyte solutions exhibit reversible Mg deposition/dissolution processes with anodic stability up to 2.7 V. The application of electrochemical cleaning pre-treatment for these solutions enabled to profoundly increase the coulombic efficiency of their Mg deposition/dissolution processes. Examining Mg prototype batteries with Mg foil anodes, composite Mo6S8 Chevrel phase (CP) cathodes containing these solutions exhibited a viable battery performance, indicating that upon a further optimization, electrolyte solutions based on the complex MgCl(THF)5+- PhAlCl3 �electrolyte may be suitable for practical RMB.",2
"A major challenge of lithium metal electrodes, in theory a suitable choice for rechargeable high energy density batteries, comprises non-homogeneous lithium deposition and the growth of reactive high surface area lithium, which eventually yields active material losses and safety risks. While it is hard to fully avoid inhomogeneous deposits, the achievable morphology of the occurring lithium deposits critically determines the long-term cycling behaviour of the cells. In this work, we focus on a combined scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Li-7-NMR) study to unravel the impact of the choice of conducting salts (LiPF6 and LiTFSI), solvents (EC : DEC, 3 : 7, DME : DOL, 1 : 1), as well as their respective concentrations (1 M, 3 M) on the electrodeposition process, demonstrating that lithium deposition morphologies may be controlled to a large extent by proper choice of cycling conditions and electrolyte constituents. In addition, the applicability of Li-7-NMR spectroscopy to assess the resulting morphology is discussed. It was found, that lithium deposition analysis based on the Li-7 chemical shift and intensity should be used carefully, as various morphologies can lead to similar results. Still, our case study reveals that the combination of SEM and NMR data is rather advantageous and offers complementary insights that may provide pathways for the future design of tailored electrolytes.",0
"At>95% Coulombic efficiencies, most of the capacity loss for Limetal anodes (LMAs) is through the formation and growth of the solidelectrolyte interphase (SEI). However, the mechanism through whichthis happens remains unclear. One property of the SEI that directlyaffects its formation and growth is the SEI's solubility inthe electrolyte. Here, we systematically quantify and compare thesolubility of SEIs derived from ether-based electrolytes optimizedfor LMAs using in-operando electrochemical quartzcrystal microbalance (EQCM). A correlation among solubility, passivity,and cyclability established in this work reveals that SEI dissolutionis a major contributor to the differences in passivity and electrochemicalperformance among battery electrolytes. Together with our EQCM, X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)spectroscopy results, we show that solubility depends on not onlythe SEI's composition but also the properties of the electrolyte.This provides a crucial piece of information that could help minimizecapacity loss due to SEI formation and growth during battery cyclingand aging.",0
"High concentration electrolytes are of growing interest in energy storage technologies, such as redox flow batteries, where multimolar active species concentrations are believed to be necessary for economic viability. However, conventional approaches for materials and electrochemical characterization of multicomponent solutions often assume dilute conditions and, consequently, are challenged by the molar-scale concentrations of redoxmers (e.g., organics, coordination complexes) and supporting salt. Further, emergent behaviors (e.g., solution structuring, molecular aggregation, phase changes) can be present at elevated concentrations, which confound traditional interpretations. Accordingly, different methods and techniques are required to determine electrochemical and transport descriptors and to link these macroscopic properties to microscopic phenomena. In this perspective, we describe the need for and difficulties inherent to experimental measurements of concentrated electrolytes; we highlight recent progress in terms of scientific insight and method development; and we suggest new directions for the research community with a particular focus on nonaqueous redox flow batteries.",16
"The formation process for lithium-ion batteries has been comprehensively investigated, while the optimization protocols for sodium-ion batteries are barely discussed. The relationship between the formation procedure and the interfacial characteristics of the electrodes, especially the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode, is of significance to the cell performance. Herein, we examine three formation protocols within a fixed potential range in superconcentrated ionic liquid electrolytes, and successfully shorten the formation time by 38x while main-taining or even enhancing the cycling performance for the sodium-ion half cell. We also correlate the SEI structure with the electrochemical performance, demonstrating that high C-rate formation contributes to a highly conductive and thinner SEI layer, which facilitates the Na+ diffusion kinetics across the electrode/electrolyte boundaries. NMR also indicates a reduced amount of NaF based SEI products on the high C-rate electrodes, consistent with XPS results. This work provides an optimized formation protocol for NIBs that is cost-effective and time efficient.",9
"Novel polyionomer lithium tetrafluoroborates including poly(1-[(4-ethenylphenyl)methyl]-3-buthyl imidazolium lithium tetrafluoroborate) (poly(EMBI/Li+)) and lithium tetrabonate poly(3-octyl-1-vinyl imidazolium lithium tetrafluoroborate) (poly(OVI/Li+)) films were synthesized for use as polymeric electrolytes in secondary lithium battery cells. The successfully synthesized of vinyl monomer with ionic properties and polyioners were confirmed via 1H-NMR, FT-IR, GC-Mass, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and impedance analysis, respectively. From impedance analysis, the ion conductivity of the poly(OVI/Li+) and poly(EMBI/Li+) films is shown as 2.69x10(-4) S/cm and 5.00x10(-7) S/cm respectively. The prepared poly(OVI/Li+) film is suitable for use as secondary lithium battery polymeric electrolyte.",0
"The expansion of the use of renewable energy sources replies on the availability soon of cheap, safe and suitable energy storage systems. In this respect batteries can be a pivotal solution. Among the available battery chemistries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the state-of-the-art coupling excellent performance, minimal self-discharge, and technological readiness. However, costs and sustainability together with safety are hindering the booming of LIBs. Aprotic sodium ion and sodium metal batteries are similar technological options with more balanced figures in terms of performance/sustainability compared to LIBs. Focusing on safety, for both LIBs and NIBs hazards are originated by liquid electrolytes that are flammable, volatile and contain fluorinated salts. Thus, technological improvements on the electrolyte side are the key also for the commercial exploitation of NIBs. Here we propose and demonstrate for the first time in the literature the use of a sodiated Nafion membrane as a singleion conductor electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries.",2
"Polymer electrolytes based on mixtures of lithium trifluoromethylsulfonylimide, LiTFSI and lithium oligoether sulfates dissolved in poly(oxyethylene) were studied. The properties of these mixed electrolytes i.e. thermal stability, ionic conductivities, transference numbers, diffusion coefficients and electrochemical stabilities were established in a wide range of compositions. A satisfactory compromise was found between high cationic transference numbers and high conductivities, while markedly decreasing the total amount of LiTFSI used. Since lithium oligoether sulfates should be considerably less expensive than LiTFSI and easy to recycle, these mixed polymer electrolytes seem to be promising. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Electrolytes are crucial to the safety and long life of Li-ion batteries, however, the understanding of their degradation mechanisms is still sketchy. Here we report on the nature and formation of organic/inorganic degradation products generated at low potential in a lithium-based cell using cyclic and linear carbonate-based electrolyte mixtures. The global formation mechanism of ethylene oxide oligomers produced from EC/DMC (1/1 w/w)-LiPF6 salt (I M) electrolyte decomposition is proposed then mimicked via chemical tests. Each intermediary product structure/formula/composition is identified by means of combined NMR, FTIR and high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) analysis. The key role played by lithium methoxide as initiator of the electrolyte degradation is evidenced, but more importantly we isolated for the first time lithium methyl carbonate as a side product of the ethylene oxide oligomers chemical formation. The same degradation mechanism was found to hold on for another cyclic and linear carbonate-based electrolyte such as EC/DEC (1/1 w/w)-LiPF6 Salt (1 M). Such findings have important implications in the choice of chemical additives for developing highly performing electrolytes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Mg batteries have been proposed as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries because of their lower cost, higher safety, and enhanced charge density. However, the Mg metal readily oxidizes when exposed to an oxidizer to form a thin MgO passivation surface layer that blocks the transport of Mg2+ across the solid electrode-electrolyte interface (SEI). In this work, the adsorption and thermal decomposition of diglyme (G2) and electrolytes containing Mg(TFSI)(2) in G2 on 10 nm-sized MgO particles are evaluated by a combination of in situ C-13 single-pulse, surface-sensitive H-1-C-1(3) cross-polarization (CP) magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance, and quantum chemistry calculations. At 180 degrees C, neat G2 decomposes on MgO to form surface-adsorbed -OCH3 groups that are captured as a distinctive peak located at about 50 ppm in the CP/MAS spectrum. At low Mg(TFSI)(2) salt concentration, the main solvation structure in this electrolyte is solvent-separated ion pairs without extensive Mg-TFSI contact ion pairs. G2, likely including a small amount of G2-solvated Mg2+, adsorbs onto the MgO surface. At high Mg(TFSI)(2) salt concentrations, contact ion pairs between Mg and TFSI are formed extensively in the solution with the first solvation shell containing one pair of Mg-TFSI and two G2 molecules and the second solvation shell containing up to six G2 molecules, namely, MgTFSI(G2)(2)(G2)(6)(+). In the presence of MgO, MgTFSI(G2)(2)(G2)(6)(+) adsorbs onto the MgO surface. At 180 degrees C, the MgO surface stimulates a desolvation process converting MgTFSI(G2)(2)(G2)(6)(+) to MgTFSI(G2)(2)(+) and releasing G2 molecules from the second solvation shell of the MgTFSI(G2) 2 (G2)(6)(+) cluster into the solution. MgTFSI(G2)(2)(+) and MgTFSI(G2)(2)(G2)(6)(+) tightly adsorb onto the MgO surface and are observed by H-1-C-13 CP/MAS experiments. The results contained herein show that electrolyte composition has a directing role in the species present on the electrode surface, which has implications on the structures and constituents of the solid-electrolyte interface on working electrodes and can be used to better understand its formation and the failure modes of batteries.",0
"The novel bifunctional methyl phosphonate which combines the good polymerization ability of acrylate, the adjustable flexibility of ethylenedioxy group and the flame retardant properties of phosphonate is designed and synthesized. The corresponding ternary gel polymer electrolyte is prepared by radical cross-linking copolymerization. The gel terpolymer electrolyte has good thermal stability with the onset decomposition temperature of 250 degrees C, excellent electrochemical stability of up to 5.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) and high ionic conductivity of 5.13 mS cm(-1). Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte can enhance interfacial adhesion between the membrane and the electrodes. The Na3V2(PO4)(3)/Na cell using phosphorus containing gel terpolymer electrolyte shows ultra-long cycling performance and better cycle stability and rate performance than the corresponding conventional liquid electrolyte, phosphorus containing gel bipolymer electrolyte and other crosslinker based cells. Meanwhile, the glass fiber separator filled with gel polymer electrolyte maintains better integrity than liquid electrolyte after 1000 cycles, which means the gel polymer electrolyte has good mechanical property and compatibility. The gel polymer electrolyte based sodium-ion battery also exhibits superior cycle stability compared to the battery with liquid electrolyte when running at high temperature of 60 degrees C.

Both compounds were synthesized in multi-step reactions and were characterized via(1)H, C-13 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirming the formation of the desired products. ThBz1 and ThBz2 showed good thermal stability and liquid crystalline behaviour. Electrochemical tests demonstrated a wide electrochemical window of 4 V for both tested ThBz compounds.

"Lithium-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on electrodes from aged and cycled lithium-ion batteries have been performed. The active cathode material was LiNi0.8Co0.2O2, and the anode consisted of a commercial graphite blend. Cells were aged by storage under 60% charge at elevated temperatures. One of the primary failure mechanisms believed to occur in these cells is the formation of a passivating layer on the positive electrode that eventually leads to loss of electrical contact between active cathode particles. The NMR spectra demonstrate buildup of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), characterized by a relatively featureless absorption centered at 0 ppm (aqueous LiCl reference). By comparing relative integrated spectral intensities of the SEI and the main cathode signal at 580 ppm, the SEI growth can be quantitatively monitored by NMR methods.

"Silicon oxide and its derivatives (SiOx, 0 < x < 2) are drawing significant interest as electrode material for Li-ion and Li-S batteries owing to their unique properties of high specific capacity, low working potential, high abundance, and environmental friendliness. In-depth research is done on the effects of electrolyte additives on the electrochemical and interfacial characteristics of SiOx-based anodes for Li-S batteries. Two different electrolyte additives namely lithium bis (fluorosulfonyl imide) (LiFSI) and lithium bis (oxalatoborate) (LiBOB) were incorporated in the supporting electrolyte containing 1 M lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl imide) (LiTFSI) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME): 1,3 dioxolane (DOL) in the ratio of 1:1 (v/v). The Li/SiOx-Si-C 2032-type half-cells were assembled, and their charge-discharge properties were explored at 0.1 C-rate. Surface morphology and electrochemical impedance investigations of the electrode materials have been performed after cycling. The interfacial properties of SiOx-based electrodes were examined by FTIR and XPS. Among the electrolytes studied LiFSI-added electrolytes offer superior charge-discharge properties, which was attributed to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the electrode surface. The surface chemistry studies revealed the formation of Li2CO3 and ROCO2Li peaks on the lithium metal surface. The formation of Li2CO3 and ROCO2Li compounds are identified on lithium surface by XPS data and complemented by NMR analysis.",10

The gel electrolyte, which shows a fire-retardance by itself as well as good chemical stability effectively improved thermal stability of the Li-ion polymer battery up to 170 degreesC. We also found that the mesocarbon microbead-based graphite showed better coulombic efficiency even though the gel electrolyte contained PC and GBL.

"The investigation of the vanadium electrolyte stability issue on the molecular-level solvation structure and the dynamics has led to the successful designing of mixed acid-based vanadium electrolytes. This new mixed-acid based electrolyte system render approximately 70% increase in energy density (approximate to 40 WhL(-1)) and approximately 80% increase in stable temperature window (-10 to +50 degrees C) compared with conventional sulfuric acid-based vanadium electrolyte. Through a comprehensive study by density functional theory and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, the improved stability is attributed to the hydrochloric acid as optimal cosolvent providing chloride anions for a ligand-exchange process in the vanadium solvation structure. The role of the chloride counteranion in the solvation structure and dynamics of vanadium species was studied using combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy and DFT-based theoretical methods. The solvation phenomenon of multiple vanadium species and their impact on vanadium redox flow battery electrolyte chemical stability are discussed.",14
"A series of phosphates is investigated as additives to improve the stability of the electrolyte for vanadium flow battery (VFB). Two selected additives show positive effect on the stability of electrolytes under ex-situ stability tests and in situ flow cell experiments. The effects of additives on electrolyte are studied by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge test. The results show that a VFB using the electrolyte with NH(4)H(2)PO(4)additive demonstrates significantly improved redox reaction reversibility and activity, and higher energy efficiency. In addition, the cell employing the electrolyte with NH4H2PO4 exhibits a charge capacity fading rate much slower than the cell without additives during the cycling at high temperature.

"We compare the electrochemistry of Mg deposition and stripping from Mg(AlCl2EtBu)(2) in THF, a common electrolyte used in Mg-ion battery prototypes, with EtMgBr, a simple Grignard reagent. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements demonstrate that mass is gained and lost from the electrode with relatively high efficiency. However, the corresponding Coulombic efficiency is considerably less than the expected 100% for early stage cycles. SEM-EDS analysis shows accumulation of Mg and electrolyte constituents after stripping, highlighting the irreversibility of the Mg deposition and stripping process. GC-MS and NMR analysis of electrolytes reveal decomposition of the solvent-electrolyte system. These findings suggest that Mg organohaloaluminates are not ideal for use in robust Mg-ion batteries.",0
"Independent of the specific electrode chemistry, the state-of-the-art lithium ion battery electrolytes based on LiPF6 in organic solvents have a low thermal abuse tolerance and poor cycle life at elevated temperatures. We present here a detailed investigation of the initial stages of the thermal decomposition of LiPF6 in EC/DMC stored at 85 degrees C using Raman and NMR spectroscopy. During storage (up to 160 h), significant amounts of CO2 are evolved, as detected in the Raman spectra. Time-resolved H-1, P-31, and F-19 NMR spectra show the evolution of POF3, POF(OH)(2), POF2(OCH2CH2)(n)F, and POF2OMe as reactive decomposition products. Our unique F-19 NMR approach, measuring while heating with both high energy and time resolution, allows for a first quantitative analysis of the evolved species and reveals several decomposition reactions during the first 30 min up to 72 h, where the rates of HF and POF2OMe formation are surprisingly linear. EC is found to be much less reactive compared to DMC. All information is used in the formulation of an updated decomposition pathway chart for LiPF6 based electrolytes.",0
"Magnesium-sulfur batteries are considered as attractive energy-storage devices due to the abundance of electrochemically active materials and high theoretical energy density. Here we report the mechanism of a Mg-S battery operation, which was studied in the presence of simple and commercially available salts dissolved in a mixture of glymes. The electrolyte offers high sulfur conversion into MgS in the first discharge with low polarization. The electrochemical conversion of sulfur with magnesium proceeds through two well-defined plateaus, which correspond to the equilibrium between sulfur and polysulfides (high-voltage plateau) and polysulfides and MgS (low-voltage plateau). As shown by XANES, RIXS (resonant inelastic X-ray scattering), and NMR studies, the end discharge phase involves MgS with Mg atoms in a tetrahedral environment resembling the wurtzite structure, while chemically synthesized MgS crystallizes in the rock-salt structure with octahedral coordination of magnesium.",10
"The first example of chloroaluminate ionic liquids (ILs) analogues based on amides of fluorinated carboxylic acids, namely 1-trifluoroacetyl piperidine (TFAP), has been described. The possibility of applying of this electrolytes has been experimentally evaluated in the series TFAP/AlCl3; TFAP/LiCl/AlCl3; TFAP/[EMIm]Cl/AlCl3; [EMIm]Cl/AlCl3 for use in an aluminum ion battery. The specific conductivities measured by the method of current interruption and impedance spectroscopy at 30 degrees C were 0.49, 0.28, 1.37, 20.23 mS cm(-1), respectively. The exchange current densities at the two-phase interface aluminium/electrolyte investigated using the impedance spectroscopy method were 0.18, 0.03, 0.42, 1100 mu A cm(-2), respectively. TFAP-based electrolytes did not crystallize when cooled down to -60 degrees C, according to DSC data. The presence of the molecular [AlCl3 (TFAP)], and the ionic AlCl4- [AlCl2(TFAP)(4)](+), and [Al(T-FAP)(6)](3-) species is proposed based on the Al-27 NMR spectra of the studied new ILs analogues.

"Cesium ion (Cs+) has been reported to be an effective electrolyte additive to suppress Li dendrite growth which prevents the application of lithium (Li) metal as an anode for rechargeable Li batteries. In this work, we investigated the effect of Cs+ additive on Li depositions using quantitative in situ Li-7 and Cs-133 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with planar symmetric Li cells. It's found that the addition of Cs+ can significantly enhance both the formation of well aligned Li nanorods and reversibility of the Li electrode. In situ Cs-133 NMR directly confirms that Cs+ migrates to Li electrode to form a positively charged electrostatic shield during the charging process. Much more electrochemical active Li was found in Li films deposited with Cs+ additive, while more electrochemical dead and thicker Li rods were identified in Li films deposited without Cs+. Combining the in situ and the previous ex-situ results, a Li deposition model has been proposed to explain these observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"A potassium salt, potassium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (KTFSA), with a weak Lewis acid in a self-extinguishing electrolyte solution containing trimethylphosphate (TMP) can improve the Coulombic efficiency of charge-discharge in lithium-ion batteries with graphite negative electrodes. O-17 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of electrolyte solutions with KTFSA indicated that weak Lewis acid K+ decreased the strength of the EC-Li+ interaction and improved the Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, three X-ray analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), clarified that the addition of KTFSA derived from the stabilization of the electrolyte solution by forming an effective protective film on the graphite surface had the greatest effect on the Coulombic efficiency.",9
"The mobilities of lithium, PF6- and solvents in the electrolyte LiPF6-(ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonatediethyl carbonate) were measured using the pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR. They were compared to those of the same electrolyte filling a macroporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane. The conductivity decrease resulting in the incorporation of this macroporous membrane and the cationic transport number were analyzed in terms of (i) solvent/polymer and solvent/salt interactions, (ii) ionic dissociation, and (iii) tortuosity.",8
"Widespread commercial adoption of polymer electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries has been hindered by subpar transport properties, namely, ionic conductivities of <1 mS/cm at room temperature and slower Li+ compared to anion transport. The developed polymer and water-in-salt electrolyte demonstrated preferential Li+ transport compared to the anion via pulsed field gradient NMR, acceptable ionic conductivities of >1 mS/cm at 25 degrees C, and an extended electrochemical stability window compared to water-in-salt electrolytes. This polymer electrolyte has a flexible liquid/solid transition through polymer molecular weight tuning, and both liquid and solid iterations are investigated. MD simulations provided additional insight into the Li+ solvation environment and the mechanism of fast, preferential Li+ transport through percolation of water-rich Li+(H2O)(n) nanodomains inside the poly(ethylene oxide) matrix.",1
"Considerable effort has been devoted to improving the cyclability of silicon (Si) negative electrodes for lithium-ion batteries because it is a promising high specific capacity alternative to graphite. In this work, the electrochemical behaviour of Si in two ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, triethyl(methyl)phosphonium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (P1222FSI) andN-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium-FSI (C(3)mpyrFSI) with high and low lithium (Li) salt content is investigated at 50 degrees C. Results highlight that higher capacity and better cycling stability are achieved over 50 cycles with high salt concentration, the first time for a pyrrolidinium-based electrolyte in the area of Si negative electrodes. However, the Si cycling performance was far superior in the P1222FSI-based high salt content electrolyte compared to that of the C(3)mpyrFSI. To understand this unexpected result, diffusivity measurements of the IL-based electrolytes were performed using PFG-NMR, while their stability was probed using MAS-NMR and XPS after long-term cycling. A higher apparent transport number for Li ions in highly concentrated ILs, combined with a significantly lower extent of electrolyte degradation explains the superior cycle life of the highly concentrated phosphonium-based system. Si/concentrated P1222FSI-LiFSI/lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) full cells with more than 3 mAh cm(-2)nominal capacity deliver a promising cycle life and good rate capability.",0
"Use of nonflammable fluorinated ethers as electrolytes for lithium secondary batteries has been studied in terms of the flammability, ionic conductivity and cell charge-discharge performances including the rate capability, cycle life and abuse (nailing) test of a graphite/LiCoO2 cylindrical cell. By mixing appropriate amounts of methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (MFE) with cosolvents (e.g., ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC)), the mixed solution showed no. ash point when evaluated by the Cleaveland open-cup flash point method (JIS 2265). The ionic conductivity was investigated for various electrolytes containing MFE with some lithium salts including LiN[SO2C2F5](2) (LiBETI) and LiN[SO2CF3](2) (LiTFSI). The solution properties of the electrolytes containing MFE were characterized in terms of the NMR chemical shifts and the diffusion coefficients by using the NMR pulse field gradient method. The graphite/LiCoO2 cylindrical cells assembled with 1 mol dm(-3) LiBETI-MFE/EMC (80:20 vol %) discharged the designed capacity (1400 mAh) at a 0.1 C rate and sustained 80% of their initial capacity up to 50 cycles. No thermal runaway was detected and cell surface temperature increased very slowly in the nailing test which meant hardly any software and hardware protections were necessary.",0
"The main impediments to the widespread acceptance of electric drive vehicles are the cost, energy-storage capacity, and durability of portable electrical energy sources and, in particular, batteries. In situ experimental techniques that can accurately detect and monitor performance degradation mechanisms on the nanoscale, including the identities of short-lived chemical species and changes in materials properties as a function of cycling rate, temperature, or time, are not widely used. Herein we demonstrate the combination of in situ ID imaging and slice-selective NMR diffusion measurements as a tool for the spatially and temporally resolved determination of lithium diffusivities in a conventional liquid electrolyte (1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution in propylene carbonate) under application of a constant electrical current. All experiments were carried out using standard NMR equipment, so the proposed technique can be easily implemented in any modern R&D facility.",1
"The acrylonitrile (AN)-methoxy polyethylene glycol (350) monoacrylate (MPGA)-lithium acrylate (LiAc) copolymers (PAMGLiAc) was synthesized by emulsion polymerization. Phase inversion technique was used to prepare the PAMGLiAc microporous membrane. The gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with the PAMGLiAc were obtained by the copolymer microporous membrane soaking liquid electrolyte. The component and structure of the PAMGLiAc were characterized by IR, NMR and TGA/DSC measurement. The electrochemical characteristics of the PAMGLiAc gel electrolytes were investigated in terms of different composition. The ionic conductivity exceeded 2.0 x 10(-3) S/cm at ambient temperature, and this system also showed good mechanical properties and a sufficient electrochemical stability with a decomposition voltage as much as 5 V vs. Li to allow far wider operation in the rechargeable lithium-ion polymer batteries.

"Zinc metal is widely used as an anode in various aqueous systems. However, zinc anode suffers from the dendrite formation on the surface upon cycling leading to a poor cyclability of a cell and its termination due to short circuit. In this work, the effect of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAH) was studied as an electrolyte additive for aqueous Zn//ZnCl2 + LiCl//LiFePO4 battery. TPAH additive prolongs the battery cycle life depending on its concentration (0.01-0.1 M). The better capacity retention over 350 cycles was observed for a symmetrical Zn//ZnCl2 + LiCl//Zn cell with 0.05 M TPAH whereas without additives the cell worked for only 110 cycles. The mechanism of TPAH influence on capacity retention is proposed based on the results of SEM and XRD analysis of the Zn anode and FTIR and NMR studies of the electrolyte. The XRD patterns of the negative electrode of the cell with TPAH indicates that zinc was preferentially deposited in a highly oriented (002) direction, which is more resistant against dendrite formation. These differences in deposited structure of Zn dendrites were confirmed by SEM images as well. FTIR and NMR spectra showed that TPAH decomposes to propylamine (RnN+H) and propene during cycling. TPAH also has an effect on the size and uniform distribution of Zn growth sides.",8
"Reversible lithium-ion (de)intercalation in the carbon-based anodes using ethylene carbonate (EC) based electrolytes has enabled the commercialization of lithium-ion batteries, allowing them to dominate the energy storage markets for hand-held electronic devices and electric vehicles. However, this issue always fails in propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolytes due to the cointercalation of Li+-PC. Herein, we report that a reversible Li+ (de)intercalation could be achieved by tuning the solvent-solvent interaction in a PC-based electrolyte containing a fluoroether. We study the existence of such previously unknown interactions mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, while the analysis reveals positive effects on the solvation structure and desolvation process. We have found that the fluoroether solvents interact with PC via their d(-)F and d(+)H atoms, respectively, leading to a reduced Li+-PC solvent interaction and effective Li+ desolvation followed by a successful Li+ intercalation at the graphite anodes. We also propose an interfacial model to interpret the varied electrolyte stability by the differences in the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the Li+-solvent and Li+-solvent-anion complexes. Compared to the conventional strategies of tuning electrolyte concentration and/or adding additives, our discovery provides an opportunity to enhance the compatibility of PC-based electrolytes with the graphite anodes, which will enable the design of high-energy density batteries (e.g., Li-S battery) with better environmental adaptabilities.",0
"The vanadium(IV) electrolyte solutions with various vanadium concentrations are studied by variable temperature H-1 and O-17 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure and kinetics of vanadium(IV) species in the electrolyte solutions are explored with respect to vanadium concentration and temperature. It was found that the vanadium(IV) species exist as hydrated vanadyl ion, i.e. [VO(H2O)(5)](2+) forming an octahedral coordination with vanadyl oxygen in the axial position and the remaining positions occupied by water molecules. This hydrated vanadyl ion structure is stable in vanadium concentrations up to 3 M and in the temperature range of 240-340 K. The sulfate anions in the electrolyte solutions are found to be weekly bound to this hydrated vanadyl ion and occupies its second-coordination sphere. The possible effects of these sulfate anions in proton and water exchange between vanadyl ion and solvent molecules are discussed based on H-1 and O-17 NMR results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Although Li metal anodes offer the highest possible specific energy density for Li-based battery chemistries, practical application is plagued by Li filament growth, with adverse effects on both Coulombic efficiency (CE) and battery safety. The structure and resulting properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li metal are critical to controlling Li deposition morphologies and achieving high-efficiency batteries. In this report, we use a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to show that fast Li transport and low solubility at the electrode/SEI interface in 0.5 M LiNO3 + 0.5 M LiTFSI electrolyte bi-salt in 1,3-dioxolane:dimethoxyethane (DOL:DME, 1:1, v/v) are responsible for the formation of low-surface-area Li deposits and high CE. This improved performance in the presence of LiNO3 is observed despite the fact that there are higher quantities and more types of compounds in the SEI than in LiTFSI alone, suggesting that the identity of the electrolyte decomposition products, rather than the amount, alters plating. SEI design strategies that increase SEI stability and Li interfacial exchange rate are thus expected to lead to more even current distribution, ultimately providing a new framework to generate smooth Li morphologies during plating/stripping.",2
"Lithium-ion highly conducting 100Li(3)PS(4)-50LiI-xLi(3)PO(4) (0 <= x <= 20 mol%) solid electrolytes were successfully prepared by liquid-phase synthesis using ethyl propionate as the reaction medium. Li3PO4 could be inserted into the Li3PS4-LiI structure (up to x = 20) without any noticeable segregated peak in the resulting X-ray diffraction patterns. P-31 NMR revealed the formation of PO2S2 and POS3 units, which confirmed that Li3PO4 reacted with Li2S-P2S5 system to form Li3PO4-xSx. Solid electrolyte with x = 10 exhibited the highest conductivity of about 8.5 x 10(-4) Scm(-1) at room temperature.",0
"Dual-graphite batteries (DGBs), which are based on anion intercalation into graphite positive electrodes, exhibit great potential for stationary energy storage due to use of more sustainable and low-cost electrode materials and processing routes. Binary-mixed highly concentrated electrolytes (HCEs) appeal highly suitable for the high operating voltages of DGBs, although the lack of sufficient insights into the formation of graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) limits the cell performance in terms of specific capacity and lifetime so far. Herein, anion intercalation from single-salt HCEs (LiPF6 and LiBF4) and an equimolar binary mixture of LiPF6/LiBF4 are studied in graphite parallel to Li metal cells, revealing an improved performance in terms of specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency in the order LiPF6 > LiPF6/LiBF4 > LiBF4. LiBF4-based cells exhibit an increased onset potential for anion intercalation and higher area specific impedance, suggesting an ineffective interphase formation at graphite. X-ray diffraction reveals GIC formation, while a lower stage number is achieved for the LiBF4-based HCE. F-19 MAS NMR spectroscopy analysis at various states-of-charge confirms no significant charge transfer between the intercalated anions and the graphite host and suggest preferred intercalation of PF6- compared to BF4- as well as a high translational and/or rotational mobility of the intercalated anions.",9
"Polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (MPEG) was grafted on poly (isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PIAMA) to synthesize comb-like lithium mono-ion conductor PIAMA-g-MPEG, which was mixed with lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonynimide(LiTFSI) to form double-lithium-salt comb polymer electrolyte membrane. Nuclear magnetic resonance CH NMR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TG) , scanning electron microscopy (SEM) , electrochemical impedance (EIS) and battery charge-discharge test were used to study the physical, chemical and electrochemical properties of polymer matrix and electrolyte. The results show that the designed double lithium salt comb polymer electrolyte can effectively dissociate and transport lithium ions, the ion mobility t(Li)(+) is 0.32 at 70 degrees C, the ion conductivity (sigma) is 1.5x10(-4) S/cm, the electrochemical stability window is 0-4.9 V (vs. Li/Li+). The assembled LiIPIAMA-g-MPEGILi battery and the constant current charge-discharge voltage polarization test at 70 degrees C show that the electrolyte has good compatibility with the metal lithium negative electrode and can effectively inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. The assembled LiFePO4 vertical bar PIAMA-g-MPEG vertical bar Li battery was subjected to 70 degrees C long cycle and rate performance test, and the electrolyte showed excellent high temperature performance.",9
"Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is one of the most promising alternatives to solve the bottlenecks of nonaqueous liquid electrolytes such as decomposition, safety hazards, and growth of dendrites. In this work, three novel methyl phosphonate-based crosslinking gel terpolymer electrolytes with different comonomers are designed and prepared by in situ radical polymerization. The gel polymer electrolytes have excellent thermal stability, wide electrochemical windows (>= 4.9 V), and high ionic conductivities (+/- 3 mS cm(-1)), and may be used as less-flammable electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries. 31P NMR spectra, Arrhenius plot, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that multifunctional phosphonate structural units promote the dissociation of NaClO4 and help to transport the sodium ions freely in the polymer framework. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that the gel polymer electrolytes have the capability of inhibiting liquid electrolyte decomposition and the formation of the stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. The Na3V2(PO4)(3)/GPE/Na cells exhibit better ultralong cycling stability and enhanced temperature performance than those of liquid cells. Strikingly, GPE1 has the best comprehensive electrochemical performance, especially the rate performance and long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention ratio of 82.6% after 3500 cycles, which indicates that different comonomers have obvious effects on the performance. Therefore, the full cell of SnS2/GPE1/Na3V2(PO4)(3) is evaluated and delivers good cycling stability of 500 cycles, holding a great prospect for the design and production of phosphorus-containing electrolytes for safer sodium-ion batteries.",10
"A combined experimental and computational study has been performed in order to elucidate the effect of electrolyte salt concentration on the performance of Li-O-2 batteries. Four electrolyte solutions with varying lithium triflimide (LiTFSI) content in 1;2-dimethoxyethane (DME) were studied to identify principal failure Mechanisms in Li-O-2 batteries for dilute and concentrated electrolytes (0.1 M to saturation) in cells cycled with high overpotentials and/or deep discharge. Quantitative F-19 NMR was employed to determine that in 0.1 M electrolyte solutions salt decomposition can contribute to limitations in cell recycling arising from low ionic conductivity due to a decrease in available soluble Li+ over multiple cycles. In contrast, increased salt decomposition in high-concentration electrolytes can result in cathode passivation by insoluble Li salts that impact capacity by hindering Li2O2 production and further inhibiting electronic conductivity. By employing first-principles calculations, we modeled different pathways for the decomposition of the TFSI anion and found that it was particularly susceptible to decomposition in its neutral state, for example, if H+ is present and bound to the TFSI anion. The cumulative results suggest that employing low-concentration electrolytes with more stable lithium salts are ideal for better cell performance.",0
"The utilization of sparingly solvating electrolytes has been reckoned as a promising approach to realizing high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries under lean electrolyte conditions through decoupling the electrolyte amount from sulfur utilization. However, the inferior wettability of high-concentration sparingly solvating electrolytes compromises mass transport, thereby impeding the maximum utilization of active material in sulfur cathodes. To address this issue, in this study, we incorporate lithium aluminate (LiAlO2) nanoflakes as an additive to sulfur cathodes to enhance the mass transport by improving the percolation and accessibility of sparingly solvating electrolytes to the bulk of the electrodes. The electrochemical kinetics of LiAlO2- containing sulfur cathodes are investigated using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The Li+ self-diffusion coefficients of electrode materials were estimated through pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) spectroscopy. Finally, a 193 Wh kg-1 Li-S pouch cell (excluding the mass of the laminated Al pouch) is demonstrated by utilizing the LiAlO2-incorporated sulfur cathode with a high S-loading of 4.3 mg cm-2 in a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 3 mu L mg-1. The Li-S pouch cell retains 80% of its initial specific cell capacity after 50 cycles. Our comprehensive understanding of the role of LiAlO2 additives in enhancing the mass transport and Li+ self-diffusion coefficient of sulfur cathodes will contribute immensely toward the development of high-energy-density Li-S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions.",14
"Lithium-sulfur (Li/S) batteries are among the most promising next-generation energy storage systems because of their high theoretical specific energy of approximate to 2600 Wh kg(-1). However, conventional Li/S batteries require high amounts of redox-inactive liquid electrolytes, which do not contribute to cell capacity. Thus, the practical specific energy of Li/S batteries is often relatively poor (<500 Wh kg(-1)) and barely competitive with Li-ion batteries. Herein, a new hybrid Li/S battery that contains both a liquid and a solid cathode, i.e., dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) and fibrous sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) (SPAN) as active materials is presented. These Li/DMTS/SPAN cells exhibit high capacity (formally up to 7100 mA h g(sulfur of cathode)(-1)), high areal capacity up to 4.3 mA h cm(-2), high rate capability up to 8 C, and excellent cycle stability (>700 cycles). In addition, both the working and aging mechanism are elucidated by NMR, Raman, X-ray photoelectron and electronic impedance spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, and postmortem analysis.",4
"We report on the experimental determination of Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell binary diffusivities using the pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) technique, which are required for the concentrated solution theory to properly describe mass transport in practical liquid electrolytes for Li batteries. The ionic conductivity, calculated based on the obtained diffusivities, matches perfectly with the experimental values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using two test solutions of either lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide or lithium bis (fluorosulfonyl) imide in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether in a temperature range of 20-50 degrees C. Accurate parametrization is achieved by reassessing the interpretation of PFG NMR-measured ionic diffusion coefficients. In particular, using the supporting theoretical background, we postulate that the diffusion coefficients represent an average of self-diffusion when the ions move independently and of the directionally correlated motion when the ions interact with each other even without the formation of neutral aggregates. A proper deconvolution of these two parts allows one to calculate the required binary diffusivities with high precision.",1
"The electrochemical performance of the aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) battery has very poor reversibility and a low charge/discharge current density owing to slow kinetic processes determined by an inevitable dissociation reaction from Al2Cl7− to free Al3+. Al2Cl6Br− was used instead of Al2Cl7− as the dissociation reaction reagent. A 15-fold faster reaction rate of Al2Cl6Br− dissociation than that of Al2Cl7− was confirmed by density function theory calculations and the Arrhenius equation. This accelerated dissociation reaction was experimentally verified by the increase of exchange current density during Al electro-deposition. Using Al2Cl6Br− instead of Al2Cl7−, a kinetically accelerated Al-S battery has a sulfur utilization of more than 80 %, with at least four times the sulfur content and five times the current density than that of previous work.",7
"Dissolution of polysulfide intermediates into electrolytes has been a major bottleneck in the development of the Al–S battery. MXenes can be promising anchoring materials, even though finding the most suitable candidates from a vast search space in a short span of time is challenging. Herein, a combined density functional theory and machine learning (ML) approach has been implemented to predict suitable M1M2XT2-type MXene materials that can optimally anchor the polysulfide intermediates. By employing various ML algorithms, the trained XGBR model is found to exhibit remarkable precision in predicting the anchoring effect of MXenes. 42 promising candidates have been identified to show optimum anchoring across the Al–S intermediates. The F and O terminal groups are found to majorly exhibit the optimum anchoring effect toward the possible polysulfide intermediates. This work provides crucial insights into the development of next-generation Al–S batteries accelerated by the ML approach, contributing to the advancement of energy storage technologies.",7
"The rechargeable aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) battery is a promising next generation electrochemical energy storage system owing to its high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g−1 and in combining low-cost and naturally abundant elements, Al and S. However, to date, its poor reversibility and low lifespan have limited its practical application. In this paper, a composite cathode is reported for Al–S batteries based on S anchored on a carbonized HKUST-1 matrix (S@HKUST-1-C). The S@HKUST-1-C composite maintains a reversible capacity of 600 mAh g−1 at the 75th cycle and a reversible capacity of 460 mAh g−1 at the 500th cycle under a current density of 1 A g−1, with a Coulombic efficiency of around 95%. X-ray diffraction and Auger spectrum results reveal that the Cu in HKUST-1 forms S–Cu ionic clusters. This serves to facilitate the electrochemical reaction and improve the reversibility of S during charge/discharge. Additionally, Cu increases the electron conductivity at the carbon matrix/S interface to significantly decrease the kinetic barrier for the conversion of sulfur species during battery operation.",7
"Rechargeable metal-sulfur batteries have emerged as viable candidates in the race for developing economically friendly and high energy-density batteries. The composition of a general metal-sulfur battery includes a metal anode and a sulfur-containing host on the cathode. The emergence of aluminum-based metal-sulfur batteries or aluminum-sulfur batteries can be attributed to the natural abundance of aluminum, considerable reduction in production cost, and high theoretical energy density. There have been several recent articles that have highlighted the use of carbon-based materials as excellent sulfur hosts in aluminum-sulfur battery cathodes. This review aims to highlight the scope and wide array of carbon-based cathode materials that have been reported recently. We have also briefly discussed the synthetic technologies and important findings of these reports in a concise form.",7
"Aluminum–sulfur batteries (ASBs) are deemed to be alternatives to meet the increasing demands for energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity, high safety, low cost, and the rich abundances of Al and S. However, the challenging problems including sluggish conversion kinetics, inferior electrolyte compatibility, and potential dendrite formation are still remained. This review comprehensively focuses on summarizing the specific strategies from polysulfide shuttling inhibition to form smooth anodic Al activation/deposition. Especially, innovations in cathodic side for achieving electrochemical kinetic modulations, electrolyte optimizations, and anodic interface mediations are discussed. Upon detailed elaborating the formation process, influencing factors, and their interactions in the Al–S electrochemistry, a comprehensive summary of their causative mechanisms and the corresponding strategies are provided, including optimization of electrolytes, innovative in situ detections, and precise electrocatalytic strategies. Based on such a systematic understanding in the Al–S electrochemistry, the possible electrochemical reaction mechanism is deciphered more clearly and enlightened practical strategies on the future development of stable ASBs. Furthermore, future opportunities and directions of high-performance conversion-based Al–S batteries for large-scale energy storage applications are highlighted.",7
"Aluminium–sulfur (Al–S) batteries possess high research merits and application prospects owing to their high theoretical energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the deficiency of outstanding cathodes severely limits their electrochemical performance. Herein, a N-doped hierarchical porous carbon material with a surface area of 2513 m2 g−1 has been developed by a soft-template method. The hierarchical pores can provide effective electrolyte transport channels and stably accommodate S nanoparticles, while the N-doped carbon can facilitate charge transfer and anchor aluminium sulfides to improve the electrochemical stability of the cathode. Coupling the S composite cathode with a low-cost AlCl3/acetamide electrolyte, the Al–S battery can deliver a capacity above 1027 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 for 50 cycles and an excellent cyclability above 483/405 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 for 500/700 cycles. In situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance have been used to monitor the reversible reactions of S and identify the configuration of sulfides, showing that α-type Al2S3 with a tetra-coordinated configuration is the dominant final discharge product. This work sheds light on the design of S composite cathodes and understanding of reaction mechanisms for the fabrication of high-reversibility, high-capacity and low-cost Al–S batteries.",7
"The chemical and electrochemical reactions at the positive electrode-electrolyte interface in Li-ion batteries are hugely influential on cycle life and safety. Ni-rich layered transition metal oxides exhibit higher interfacial reactivity than their lower Ni-content analogues, reacting via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we study the pivotal role of the electrolyte solvent, specifically cyclic ethylene carbonate (EC) and linear ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), in determining the interfacial reactivity at charged LiNi0.33Mn0.3 Co0.33O2 (NMC111) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes by using both single-solvent model electrolytes and the mixed solvents used in commercial cells. While NMC111 exhibits similar parasitic currents with EC-containing and EC-free electrolytes during high voltage holds in NMC/Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) cells, this is not the case for NMC811. Online gas analysis reveals that the solvent-dependent reactivity for Ni-rich cathodes is related to the extent of lattice oxygen release and accompanying electrolyte decomposition, which is higher for EC-containing than EC-free electrolytes. Combined findings from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), TEM, solution NMR, ICP, and XPS reveal that the electrolyte solvent has a profound impact on the degradation of the Ni-rich cathode and the electrolyte. Higher lattice oxygen release with EC-containing electrolytes is coupled with higher cathode interfacial impedance, a thicker oxygen-deficient rock-salt surface reconstruction layer, more electrolyte solvent and salt breakdown, and higher amounts of transition metal dissolution. These processes are suppressed in the EC-free electrolyte, highlighting the incompatibility between Ni-rich cathodes and conventional electrolyte solvents. Finally, new mechanistic insights into the chemical oxidation pathways of electrolyte solvents and, critically, the knock-on chemical and electrochemical reactions that further degrade the electrolyte and electrodes curtailing battery lifetime are provided.",16
"The vanadium(V) cation structures in mixed acid based electrolyte solution were analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) based computational modeling and V-51 and Cl-35 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The vanadium(V) cation exists as di-nuclear [V2O3Cl2 center dot 6H(2)O](2+) compound at higher vanadium concentrations (>= 1.75 M). In particular, at high temperatures (>295 K) this di-nuclear compound undergoes ligand exchange process with nearby solvent chlorine molecule and forms chlorine bonded [V2O3Cl center dot 6H(2)O](2+) compound. This chlorine bonded [V2O3Cl2 center dot 6H(2)O]2+ compound might be resistant to the de-protonation reaction which is the initial step in the precipitation reaction in vanadium based electrolyte solutions. The combined theoretical and experimental approach reveals that formation of chlorine bonded [V2O3Cl2 center dot 6H(2)O](2+) compound might be central to the observed higher thermal stability of mixed acid based vanadium(V) electrolyte solutions.

"The reaction mechanism of the new SEI additive 1-Fluoropropane-2-one in combination with the well-known SEI additive vinylene carbonate in propylene carbonate based electrolytes is investigated. Spectroscopic measurements support the proposition that 1-Fluoropropane-2-one is reduced first and that the reduced species then initiate vinylene carbonate decomposition. Cyclic voltammetry shows only a decomposition peak of the additive FA in the first cycle and does not show any evidence for subsequent vinylene carbonate decomposition at lower potential. NMR spectroscopy shows that after one cycle the signal representing the C-F bonds decreases. In situ Raman measurements show that the decomposition of vinylene carbonate occurs in the same potential range as 1-Fluoropropane-2-one, meaning that the VC decomposition is shifted to higher potentials. Finally, XPS measurements demonstrate that this electrolyte with two additives forms a LiF-rich SEI. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Li-7 and H-1 magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra were recorded for Li(Ni, Co, Al) O-2 samples. The Li-7 MAS NMR signal of the layer on the pristine material is close to that of Li2CO3 in close contact with it. Its lineshape, due to dipolar interaction with electron spins of the material, is drastically different from that of pure Li2CO3. Upon hydration, this layer grows, while H-1 NMR suggests that some lithium in the material is replaced by protons. Upon electrochemical cycling, the original layer is replaced by a different one, the solid electrolyte interphase, with distinct Li-7 and H-1 NMR signatures, showing its largely organic nature.

"Poly(acrylonitrile-co-butyl acrylate) (P(AN-co-BuA))/poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) blend-based gel polymer electrolyte (BGPE) was prepared for lithium-ion batteries. The P(AN-co-BuA)/PVC BGPE consists of an electrolyte-rich phase, which is mainly composed of P(AN-co-BuA) and liquid electrolyte, acting as a conducting channel and a PVC-rich phase that provides mechanical strength. The dual phase was just simply developed by the difference of miscibility properties in solvent, PC, between P(AN-co-BuA) and PVC. The mechanical strength of this new blend electrolyte was found to be much higher, with a fracture stress as high as 29 MPa in dry membrane and 21 MPa in gel state, than that of a previously reported P(AN-co-BuA)-based gel polymer electrolyte. The blended gel polymer electrolyte showed ionic conductivity of higher than 1.5 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and electrochemical stability up to at least 4.8 V. The results showed that the as-prepared get polymer electrolytes were Promising materials for lithium-ion batteries. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Because of its high specific capacity, silicon is regarded as the most promising candidate to be incrementally added to graphite-based negative electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. However, silicon suffers from significant volume changes upon (de-)lithiation leading to continuous re-formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and ongoing active lithium losses. One prominent approach to compensate for active lithium losses is pre-lithiation. Here, the contact pre-lithiation of silicon/graphite (Si/Gr) negative electrodes in direct contact with passivated Li metal powder (PLMP) is studied, focusing on the pre-lithiation mechanism in dry state and after electrolyte addition. PLMP is pressed onto the electrode surface to precisely adjust the degree of pre-lithiation (25%, 50%, and 75%). By in situ XRD and ex situ Li-7 NMR studies, it is proven that significant lithiation of Si/Gr electrodes occurs by direct contact to Li metal, that is, without electrolyte. After electrolyte addition, de-lithiation of silicon and graphite is confirmed, resulting in SEI formation. The amount of Li metal highly impacts the presence and durability of the LixC and LixSi phases. Finally, the challenges for homogeneous pre-lithiation and SEI formation are identified, and the impact of electrolyte addition is assessed by analysis of the lateral and in-depth lithium distribution within the Si/Gr electrode.",0
"High oxygen radical stability of electrolyte solvent is a key parameter necessary to overcome a large voltage gap in discharge-charge profiles of the non-aqueous Li-air battery. We have proposed N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethansulfonyl)amide (PP13TFSA) as an appropriate candidate of the electrolyte solvent. PP13TFSA based Li-O-2 cells enabled us to draw low charging voltage of around 3.3 V, lowering the voltage gap by nearly half in comparison with those of conventional carbonate-based cells (c.a. 1.4 V). Here, through the detailed analyses of discharge products, we verified the fact that the voltage gap was notably decreased by using the highly radical stable electrolyte solvent. TEM-EELS and Fr-IR analyses indicated that Li2O2 was deposited as a discharge product. C-13 NMR spectroscopy suggested that no decomposed species derived from electrolyte decomposition was observed from a discharged cathode. GC-MS analyses also revealed that CO and CO2 gases as indices of the decomposed species were not monitored at all. Above-described data substantiated a desirable discharge reaction, resulting in low charging voltage as well as small voltage gap. Design of electrolyte solvents based on their oxygen radical stability and full understanding of the cathode reaction mechanism contributed greatly to a dramatic improvement of the Li-air battery performances.

"An improved synthesis of fluorine-containing room temperature ionic liquids (FRTILs) is described. Twelve FRTILs are synthesized, in which the fluorinated cations based on N-methyl pyrrolidinium (MPy), 1-methly imidazolium (MIm) and diethylsulfide (DES) are associated with anions, such as dicyanamide (DCA) or bis (trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (TFSI). The molecular structures of these FRTILs were confirmed by FT-IR, H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and elemental analysis. The FRTILs have been investigated for their potential as electrolyte solvents, especially for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Thermal behaviors were also studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showing excellent thermal stability, exceeding 150 degrees C, for all FRTILs. Some of their physicochemical properties were determined, including density, flammability, viscosity, and miscibility with polar and nonpolar solvents. Due to the high viscosity of FRTILs, two low viscosity ILs (co-solvent thinners), [MImEt] [DCA] and [MImEt] [TFSI], have been synthesized and used to dilute the FRTILs. The resulting ternary electrolyte systems, LiTFSI in 1:1 wt.% FRTILs/thinner, were characterized by their ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability.",8
"Lithium-conducting nanocomposite polymer electrolytes based on high molecular weight poly(oxyethylene) (POE) were prepared from high aspect ratio cellulosic whiskers and lithium imide LiTFSI salt. The thermomechanical behavior of the resulting films was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical analysis. The ionic conductivity and the electrochemical stability of the nanocomposite polymer electrolytes are quite consistent with the specifications of lithium batteries. The ionic mobilities were determined by pulsed magnetic field gradient NMR, and it was shown that the reinforcement does not affect the lithium transference number. High performance nanocomposite electrolytes based on tunicin whiskers were obtained. Indeed, the filler provides a high reinforcing effect, while a high level of ionic conductivity is retained with respect to unfilled polymer electrolytes.",3

"Accurate measurement of the cation transference number is critical for designing batteries with a given electrolyte. A promising approach for measuring this parameter is electrophoretic NMR (eNMR). In the standard approach, the average cation, anion, and solvent velocities under an applied electric field are used to estimate the cation transference number with respect to the solvent velocity, t(+)(0) . In this study, we show that t(+)(0) can be determined from measurements of the electric -field-induced velocities of individual species. The t(+)(0 )values obtained from eNMR experiments on a model electrolyte (LiTFSI/tetraglyme) based on single species velocities are consistent with the standard approach. An important parameter that enters into the analysis is the velocity of the electrode-electrolyte interface which must be finite in an eNMR experiment. Agreement is only obtained after accounting for this velocity. The single-species approach is particularly valuable when one or more components of the electrolytic mixture are not easily accessible by NMR, for example zinc and magnesium cations.",2
"Redox flow batteries (RFBs) rely on the development of cheap, highly soluble, and high-energy-density electrolytes. Several candidate quinones have already been investigated in the literature as two-electron anolytes or catholytes, benefiting from fast kinetics, high tunability, and low cost. Here, an investigation of nitrogen-rich fused heteroaromatic quinones was carried out to explore avenues for electrolyte development. These quinones were synthesized and screened by using electrochemical techniques. The most promising candidate, 4,8-dioxo-4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d ']bis([1,2,3]triazole)-1,5-diide (-0.68 V(SHE)), was tested in both an asymmetric and symmetric full-cell setup resulting in capacity fade rates of 0.35% per cycle and 0.0124% per cycle, respectively. In situ ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies were used to investigate the electrochemical stability of the charged species during operation. UV-Vis spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory (DFT) modeling, reaffirmed that the two-step charging mechanism observed during battery operation consisted of two, single-electron transfers. The radical concentration during battery operation and the degree of delocalization of the unpaired electron were quantified with NMR and EPR spectroscopy.",9
"Rechargeable magnesium batteries have attracted much interest due their high volumetric capacity, potential for safe operation, and the natural abundance of magnesium. However, the development of magnesium batteries for practical applications has been obstructed by the lack of understanding of the liquid structure of electrolytes. Herein, we use quantum density functional theory coupled with a continuum solvation model to investigate the structure of Mg(BH4)(2) in two ethereal solvents: tetrahydrofuran (THF), and monoglyme (G1). The most energetically favorable clusters of Mg(BH4)(2), MgBH4+, and Mg-2(+), with associated solvent molecule ligands, are determined. The free energy required to generate monovalent ions in the electrolyte is positive and the formation of divalent complexes is prohibitive. Singly and doubly charged complexes are more stable in G1 than THF, which is consistent with experimental findings. From the standpoint of free energy, clusters containing multiple magnesium atoms are not favored. Theoretical Mg-25-NMR, B-11-NMR spectra, and infrared vibrational modes of borohydride were calculated for each cluster. The relationships between cluster charge and the signals of each spectrum are determined. These analytical descriptors could be useful to characterize the degree of ion dissociation in the electrolyte. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.",16
"Organic solutions of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) are promising electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. Information on the diffusion coefficients of the species in these solutions is needed for battery design. Therefore, the self-diffusion coefficients in such solutions were studied experimentally with the pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance technique. The self-diffusion coefficients of the ions Li+ and FSI- as well as those of the solvents were measured for LiFSI solutions in pure dimethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate as well as in mixtures of these solvents at 298 K and ambient pressure. Despite the Li+ ion being the smallest species in the solution, its self-diffusion coefficient is the lowest as a result of its strong coordination with the solvent molecules.",0
"Described herein presents a class of novel deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) with distinctive properties for sodium batteries. Instead of being limited by the presence of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) or hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), the concept of Na center dot center dot center dot N interactions was first brought in between sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) and 1,2-dimethylimidazole (DMIm). The deep eutectic phenomenon was caused by the strong ion-dipole interaction, which was conducive to the release of Na+ from NaFSI and drove the DEE with a desirable ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism of Na center dot center dot center dot N interactions was credibly confirmed by Raman, 23Na NMR, and theoretical calculations. The half-cell based on NaFSI/ DMIm-1/4 can provide a reversible capacity of 316.7 mAh center dot g-1 at 0.05 A center dot g-1, and Coulombic efficiency remains 91% after 500 charge- discharge cycles at 1.0 A center dot g-1 in the application of sodium batteries. It is anticipated that this work will present distinct insights into the extension of electrolytes for sodium batteries.",8
"Ionic liquids (ILs) continue to show relevance in many fields, from battery electrolytes, to carbon capture, to advanced separations. These highly ion-dense fluids present unique challenges in understanding their electrochemical properties due to deviations in behavior from existing electrolyte theories. Here we present a novel characterization of ILs using electrophoretic NMR (ENMR) to determine separate cation and anion mobilities. This method uses an applied electric field coincident with a pulsed magnetic field gradient to encode the E-field driven flow into NMR signals for cations (H-1) and anions (F-19). We describe the detailed design of these experiments, including quantitative analysis of artifact mitigation and necessary control experiments. We then explore mobilities and diffusion coefficients for two representative ILs: 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C(2)mim][BF4]) and 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([C(2)mim][TfO]). We further use the individual ion mobilities to calculate the bulk net conductivity, which closely agrees with bulk conductivity measurements obtained using impedance spectroscopy. These observations represent the first reliable measurements of cation and anion mobilities in pure ILs, with errors of +/- 7%. We discuss this advanced experimental methodology in detail, as well as implications of these sensitive measurements for understanding conduction mechanisms in ion-dense electrolytes.

"A nickel-rich LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode possesses high specific capacity and high discharge voltage, as the most promising cathode for high energy density lithium ion batteries, but suffers from serious cycling degradation. The present study revealed that the NCA cathode is stable with excellent cycling stability at voltages below 4.2 V, but suffers from serious degradation at voltages above 4.35 V. The characterization from SEM, TEM, XPS, FTIR, NMR, XRD and ICP as well as electrochemical measurements supported by theoretical calculations revealed that the trace of HF initially present in battery grade electrolytes likely induces the cycling stability degradation of the nickel-rich NCA cathode via accelerating the electrolyte decomposition. Our further research demonstrated that such cycling stability degradation can be eliminated through applying diethyl phenylphosphonite (DEPP) as an electrolyte additive, as DEPP is capable of shielding HF besides its ability to construct a protective cathode interphase, resulting in an excellent cycling stability of the nickel-rich NCA cathode.",0
"Seven solvent-free solid polymer electrolytes based on cross-linked polyethers and doped with LiN(CF3SO2)(2), were investigated for usage in large-scale rechargeable lithium batteries. They are classified into two categories: one contains five poly(ethyleneoxide-co-propyleneoxide) (poly(EO-co-PO)) network polymers with different degrees of cross-linking and precursor molecular weight and the other includes two polyethers with borate structure having a Lewis acid functionality as an anion trap. The ionic conductivity, direct current characteristics, thermal properties and transference numbers were measured. To evaluate the battery performance for the polymer electrolytes, test cells of the typical Li/solvent-free solid polymer electrolyte/LiCoO2, were fabricated. High discharge performance was obtained for the solvent-free electrolytes made of the less cross-linked poly(EO-co-PO) and for the PEO including borate structure. A 10 Wh class lithium battery was entirely fabricated from solid components, and 500 charge-discharge cycles with 100% capacity retention was demonstrated.

"Knowledge about capacity losses related to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is still limited. One major challenge in SIBs is that the solubility of SEI species in liquid electrolytes is comparatively higher than the corresponding species formed in Li-ion batteries. This study sheds new light on the associated capacity losses due to initial SEI formation, SEI dissolution and subsequent SEI reformation, charge leakage via SEI and subsequent SEI growth, and diffusion-controlled sodium trapping in electrode particles. By using a variety of electrochemical cycling protocols, synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, capacity losses due to changes in the SEI layer during different open circuit pause times are investigated in nine different electrolyte solutions. It is shown that the amount of capacity lost depends on the interplay between the electrolyte chemistry and the thickness and stability of the SEI layer. The highest capacity loss is measured in NaPF6 in ethylene carboante mixed with diethylene carbonate electrolyte (i.e., 5 mu Ah h-1/2pause or 2.78 mAh g center dot h-1/2pause) while the lowest value is found in NaTFSI in ethylene carbonate mixed with dimethoxyethance electrolyte (i.e., 1.3 mu Ah h-1/2pause or 0.72 mAh g center dot h-1/2pause).A detailed quantification of different aging mechanisms related to electrolyte solution and negative electrode is presented in this study. The dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), diffusion-controlled ion trapping, continuous SEI dissolution and reformation, and chemical desodiation and SEI growth in sodium-ion batteries are discussed here using a variety of analytical tools.image",0

"Paper-based batteries represent a new frontier in battery technology. However, low-flexibility and poor ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes have been major impediments in achieving practical mechanically flexible batteries. This work discuss new highly ionic conductive polymer gel electrolytes for paper-based battery applications. In this paper, we present a poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDH-HFP) porous membrane electrolyte enhanced with lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulphone) imide (LiTFSI) and lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP), with an ionic conductivity of 2.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1). Combining ceramic (LATP) with the gel structure of PVDF-HFP and LiTFSI ionic liquid harnesses benefits of ceramic and gel electrolytes in providing flexible electrolytes with a high ionic conductivity. In a flexibility test experiment, bending the polymer electrolyte at 90. for 20 times resulted in 14% decrease in ionic conductivity. Efforts to further improving the flexibility of the presented electrolyte are ongoing. Using this electrolyte, full-cell batteries with lithium titanium oxide (LTO) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) electrodes and (i) standard metallic current collectors and (ii) paper-based current collectors were fabricated and tested. The achieved specific capacities were (i) 123 mAh g(-1) for standard metallic current collectors and (ii) 99.5 mAh g(-1) for paper-based current collectors.

"A comparative investigation of the different lithium salts on formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on binder free graphite anodes for lithium ion batteries has been conducted. The electrolytes investigated include 1 M LiPF6, LiBF4, LiTFSI, LiFSI, LiDFOB or LiBOB dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC). The SEI has been investigated via a combination of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allows direct observation of the SEI formed from the different electrolytes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of D2O extracts are utilized to characterize the soluble species of SEI. XPS and FTIR provide additional elemental and functional group information for the SEI components. The SEI for all electrolytes contains lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC), the primary reduction product of EC. In addition, the SEI for all electrolytes contain LiF except for the SEI generated from the LiBOB electrolyte.

"Anisotropic battery electrodes that allow enhanced diffusion through the thickness of the electrode can be engineered to improve the rate performance, but direct measurement of 3D diffusion in this pore structure is extremely challenging. To address this, we used H-1 and Li-7 pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR to measure anisotropic diffusion in a model porous silicon substrate. We show that NMR spectroscopy can resolve solvent molecules and ions (here, in H2O, DMSO, and the battery electrolyte LIPF6:DC:EMC) in and outside of the pores of the Si substrate, allowing the diffusion coefficients of the ion/molecules in the two components to be individually determined. Exchange between ions/molecules inside and outside of the pores is observed with H-1 2D exchange spectroscopy (EXSY). The pore dimensions can extracted from the diffusivity of the in-pore component and the results are in reasonable agreement with the pore dimensions measured with electron microscopy. Better agreement is obtained for pore diameters; for pore length measurements, exchange between the in-pore and ex-pore solvents should be accounted for. These results suggest that PFG-NMR can serve as a non-destructive characterisation method for both in situ and ex situ analyses of materials ranging from complex battery and supercapacitor electrodes to catalyst supports and tissue scaffolds.",0
"Choline-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are potential candidates to replace flammable organic solvent electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The effect of the addition of a lithium salt on the structure and dynamics of the material needs to be clarified before it enters the battery. Here, the archetypical DES choline chloride:urea at 1:2 mole fraction has been added with lithium chloride at two different concentrations and the effect of the additional cation has been evaluated with respect to the non-doped system via multinuclear NMR techniques. H-1 and Li-7 spin-lattice relaxation times and diffusion coefficients have been measured between 298 K and 373 K and revealed a decrease in both rotational and translational mobility of the species after LiCl doping at a given temperature. Temperature dependent Cl-35 linewidths reflect the viscosity increase upon LiCl addition, yet keep track of the lithium complexation. Quantitative indicators such as correlation times and activation energies give indirect insights into the intermolecular interactions of the mixtures, while lithium single-jump distance and transference number shed light into the lithium transport, being then of help in the design of future DES electrolytes.",0
"The physicochemical properties of a range of NaNTf2 (or NaTFSI) salt concentrations in N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (or C(3)mpyrFSI) ionic liquid were investigated by DSC, conductivity, cyclic voltammetry and diffusivity studies. Cyclic voltammetry indicated a stable sodium plating behavior with a current of 5 mA cm(-2) at 25 degrees C to 20 mA cm(-2) at 100 degrees C, along with high reversibility identifying this electrolyte as a possible candidate for sodium-ion or sodium metal battery applications. Na-23 NMR chemical shifts and spectral linewidths (FWHM) indicate a complex coordination of the Na+ ion which is dependent on both temperature and salt concentration with an apparently stronger coordination to the NTf2 anion upon increasing the NaNTf2 concentration. Temperature dependent PFG-NMR diffusion measurements show that both FSI and NTf2 have a comparable behaviour although the smaller FSI anion is more diffusive.",3
"Highly reductive magnesium borohydride [Mg(BH4)(2)] is compatible with metallic Mg, making it a promising Mg-ion electrolyte for rechargeable Mg batteries. However, pure Mg(BH4)(2) in ether-based solutions displays very limited solubility (0.01 M), low oxidative stability (<1.8 V vs Mg), and nucleophilic characteristic, all of which preclude its practical utilization for any battery applications. Herein, we present a multifunctional additive of tris(2H-hexafluoroisopropyl)borate (THFPB) for preparing Mg(BH4)(2)-based electrolytes. By virtue of the strong electron-acceptor ability of the THFPB molecule, a transparent and high-concentration Mg(BH4)(2)/THFPB-diglyme (DGM) electrolyte (0.5 M, almost 50 times higher than that of the pristine Mg(BH4)(2)-DGM electrolyte) is first obtained, which shows dramatic performance improvements, including high ionic conductivity (3.72 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C) and high Mg plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency (>99%). The newly-generated active cation and anion species revealed by Raman, NMR and MS spectra, increase the electrochemical potential window from 1.8 V to 2.8 V vs Mg on stainless steel electrode, rendering electrolytes the ability to examine high voltage cathodes. More importantly, on account of the non-nucleophilicity of active electrolyte species, we present the first example of magnesium(--)sulfur (Mg-S) batteries using Mg(BH4)(2)-based electrolytes, which exhibit a high discharge capacity of 955.9 and 526.5 mA h g(-1) at the initial and 30th charge/discharge cycles, respectively. These achievements not only provide an efficient and specific strategy to eliminate the major roadblocks facing Mg(BH4)(2)-based electrolytes but also highlight the profound effect of functional additives on the electrochemical performances of unsatisfied Mg-ion electrolytes.",2
"Alternative electrolyte systems such as hybrid electrolytes are much sought after to overcome safety issues related to liquid electrolytes in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Hybrid solid-liquid electrolytes (HEs) like the heterogeneous structural battery electrolyte (SBE) consist of two discrete co-existing phases prepared by polymerization-induced phase separation: one solid polymer phase providing mechanical integrity and the other one a percolating liquid ion-conducting phase. The present work investigates the ion and the solvent mobility in a series of HEs using morphological, electrochemical impedance and NMR spectroscopic methods. All the dried HEs exhibit a porous structure with a broad pore size distribution stretching down to <10 nm diameter. Penetration of the individual components of the solution, that is the ions and the solvent, in the solid polymer phase is demonstrated. Yet, it is the pores that are the main ion conduction channels in the liquid-saturated HEs and, in general, translational mobility is strongly dependent on the volume fraction and size of the pores and, thereby, on the initial liquid electrolyte content. We also observe that the translational mobility of solvent and the ions vary differently with the pore volume fraction. This finding is explained by the presence of small mesopores where the mobility strongly depends on the specific interactions of the molecular constituent with the pore wall. These interactions are inferred to be stronger for the EC/PC solvent than for the ions. This study shows how the morphology and the chemical composition of HEs affect the ionic and molecular transport in the system.",0
"The surface reactions of electrolytes with the graphitic anode of lithium ion batteries have been investigated. The investigation utilizes two novel techniques, which are enabled by the use of binder-free graphite anodes. The first method, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, allows straightforward analysis of the graphite solid electrolyte interphase (SE!). The second method utilizes multi-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of D2O extracts from the cycled anodes. The TEM and NMR data are complemented by XPS and FTIR data, which are routinely used for SEI studies. Cells were cycled with LiPF6 and ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and EC/EMC blends. This unique combination of techniques establishes that for EC/LiPF6 electrolytes, the graphite SEI is similar to 50 nm thick after the first full lithiation cycle, and predominantly contains lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) and LiF. In cells containing EMC/LiPF6 electrolytes, the graphite SEI is nonuniform, similar to 10-20 nm thick, and contains lithium ethyl carbonate (LEC), lithium methyl carbonate (LMC), and LiF. In cells containing EC/EMC/LiPF6 electrolytes, the graphite SEI is similar to 50 nm thick, and predominantly contains LEDC, LMC, and LiF.",0
"A fluorinated carbonate (4-(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoro-pentyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 1) was synthesized from the corresponding oxirane through a one-step carbonation reaction. The compound was obtained in quantitative yield with battery-grade purity on a 50g scale. Carbonate 1 was fully characterized by NMR, IR, MS, and crystal structure analysis. The compound melts at 98 degrees C and decomposes at 168 degrees C. When used as additive in lithium-ion half- and full-cell tests, 1 exhibited no reactivity toward the graphite anode, no participation in the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and led to a higher oxidation stability of the electrolyte against a carbon black electrode, compared to 4-fluoro-ethylenecarbonate and 4-trifluoromethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one. The facile, clean, and scalable one-step synthesis of 1 combined with its electrochemical behavior characterizes it as a promising additive for high voltage applications in lithium-ion batteries.",0
"This is the first report of a multifunctional separator for potassium-metal batteries (KMBs). Double-coated tape-cast microscale AlF3 on polypropylene (AlF3@PP) yields state-of-the-art electrochemical performance: symmetric cells are stable after 1000 cycles (2000 h) at 0.5 mA cm(-2) and 0.5 mAh cm(-2), with 0.042 V overpotential. Stability is maintained at 5.0 mA cm(-2) for 600 cycles (240 h), with 0.138 V overpotential. Postcycled plated surface is dendrite-free, while stripped surface contains smooth solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional PP cells fail rapidly, with dendrites at plating, and dead metal and SEI clumps at stripping. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) cathode KMBs with AlF3@PP display enhanced capacity retention (91% at 100 cycles vs 58%). AlF3 partially reacts with K to form an artificial SEI containing KF, AlF3, and Al2O3 phases. The AlF3@PP promotes complete electrolyte wetting and enhances uptake, improves ion conductivity, and increases ion transference number. The higher of K+ transference number is ascribed to the strong interaction between AlF3 and FSI- anions, as revealed through F-19 NMR. The enhancement in wetting and performance is general, being demonstrated with ester- and ether-based solvents, with K-, Na-, or Li- salts, and with different commercial separators. In full batteries, AlF3 prevents Fe crossover and cycling-induced cathode pulverization.",9
"We report the development of in situ (online) EPR and coupled EPR/NMR methods to study redox flow batteries, which are applied here to investigate the redox-active electrolyte, 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ). The radical anion, DHAQ(,)(3-center dot) formed as a reaction intermediate during the reduction of DHAQ(2-), was detected and its concentration quantified during electrochemical cycling. The fraction of the radical anions was found to be concentration-dependent, the fraction decreasing as the total concentration of DHAQ increases, which we interpret in terms of a competing dimer formation mechanism. Coupling the two techniques-EPR and NMR-enables the rate constant for the electron transfer between DHAQ(3-center dot) and DHAQ(4-) anions to be determined. We quantify the concentration changes of DHAQ during the high-voltage hold by NMR spectroscopy and correlate it quantitatively to the capacity fade of the battery. The decomposition products, 2,6-dihydroxyanthrone and 2,6-dihydroxyanthranol, were identified during this hold; they were shown to undergo subsequent irreversible electrochemical oxidation reaction at 0.7 V, so that they no longer participate in the subsequent electrochemistry of the battery when operated in the standard voltage window of the cell. The decomposition reaction rate was found to be concentration-dependent, with a faster rate being observed at higher concentrations. Taking advantage of the inherent flow properties of the system, this work demonstrates the possibility of multi-modal in situ (online) characterizations of redox flow batteries, the characterization techniques being applicable to a range of electrochemical flow systems.",10
"Li-S batteries are a promising next-generation battery technology. Due to the formation of soluble polysulfides during cell operation, the electrolyte composition of the cell plays an active role in directing the formation and speciation of the soluble lithium polysulfides. Recently, new classes of electrolytes termed solvates that contain stoichiometric quantities of salt and solvent and form a liquid at room temperature have been explored due to their sparingly solvating properties with respect to polysulfides. The viscosity of the solvate electrolytes is understandably high limiting their viability; however, hydrofluoroether cosolvents, thought to be inert to the solvate structure itself, can be introduced to reduce viscosity and enhance diffusion. Nazar and co-workers previously reported that addition of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) to the LiTFSI in acetonitrile solvate, (MeCN)(2)-LiTFSI, results in enhanced capacity retention compared to the neat solvate. Here, we evaluate the effect of TTE addition on both the electrochemical behavior of the Li-S cell and the solvation structure of the (MeCN)(2)-LiTFSI electrolyte. Contrary to previous suggestions, Raman and NMR spectroscopy coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that TTE coordinates to Li+ at the expense of MeCN coordination, thereby producing a higher content of free MeCN, a good polysulfide solvent, in the electrolyte. The electrolytes containing a higher free MeCN content facilitate faster polysulfide formation kinetics during the electrochemical reduction of S in a Li-S cell likely as a result of the solvation power of the free MeCN.",0
"Ionic liquid electrolytes have been utilized in rechargeable batteries, yet their effect on the anode interphase evolution has been barely studied. Herein, we investigate the interfacial characteristics of carbon anodes in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) in contact with superconcentrated sodium bis(fluoromethane)sulfonimide (NaFSI)/N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluoromethane) sulfonimide (C3mpyrFSI). A long cycle life of the cell, up to 3500 cycles with 320 mAh/g, is achieved, which is contributed by the anion-derived inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode. Comparison is made with a traditional carbonate electrolyte using the same sodium salt (1 M NaFSI in EC/DMC), showing that the latter results in a thick organic-dominant SEI layer from decomposition of the organic solvents. Here we correlate the influence of the anion decomposition species in the IL electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, and accelerated Na desolvation and faster diffusion kinetics, giving some fundamental insights into interfacial phenomena in NIBs.",8
"Cyclodextrins (CDs) are pyranoside-based macromolecules with a hydrophobic cavity to encapsulate small molecules. They are used as molecular vehicles, for instance in pharmaceutical drug delivery or as solubility enhancer of monomers for their polymerization in aqueous solution. In this context, it was discovered about 10 years ago that the bis(trifluoromethylsulonyl)imide (TFSI) anion forms host-guest complexes with beta CD in aqueous media. This sparked interest in using the TFSI anion in lithium-based battery electrolytes open for its encapsulation by beta CD as an attractive approach to increase the contribution of the cation to the total ion conductivity. By using semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods and the conductor-like screening model for a real solvent (COSMO-RS), a randomly methylated beta CD (RM beta CD) is here identified as a suitable host for TFSI when using organic solvents often used in battery technology. By combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with different NMR and FTIR experiments, the formation of the corresponding RM beta CD-TFSI complex was investigated. Finally, the effects of the addition RM beta CD to a set of electrolytes on the ion conductivity are measured and explained using three distinct scenarios.",0
"Aqueous Li-ion batteries have long been envisioned as safe and green energy storage technology, but have never been commercially realized owing to the limited electrochemical stability window of water, which drastically hampers their energy density. Recently, Water-in-Salt electrolytes (WiSEs) in which a large amount of organic salt is dissolved into water were proposed to allow for assembling 3 V Li-ion batteries. Hereby, our attention focused on the fate of water at the electrochemical interface under negative polarization and the potential reactivity of TFSI anions with products originating from the water reduction. Hence, combining analysis of bulk electrolytes with electrochemical measurements on model electrodes and operando characterization, we were able to demonstrate that hydroxides generated during the hydrogen evolution reaction can chemically react with TFSI and catalyze the formation of a fluorinated solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) that prevents further water reduction. Mastering this new SEI formation path with the chemical degradation of TFSI anions mediated by the electrochemical reduction of water can therefore open new avenues for the future development of not only WiSEs but also Li batteries functioning in organic electrolytes.",1
"Rechargeable batteries are notoriously difficult to examine nondestructively, and the obscurity of many failure modes provides a strong motivation for developing efficient and detailed diagnostic techniques that can provide information during realistic operating conditions. In-situ NMR spectroscopy has become a powerful technique for the study of electrochemical processes, but has mostly been limited to laboratory cells. One significant challenge to applying this method to commercial cells has been that the radiofrequency, required for NMR excitation and detection, cannot easily penetrate the battery casing due to the skin depth. This complication has limited such studies to special research cell designs or to 'inside-out' measurement approaches. This article demonstrates that it is possible to use the battery cell as a resonator in a tuned circuit, thereby allowing signals to be excited inside the cell, and for them to subsequently be detected via the resonant circuit. Employing this approach, Li-7 NMR signals from the electrolyte, as well as from intercalated and plated metallic lithium in a multilayer (rolled) commercial pouch cell battery were obtained. Therefore, it is anticipated that critical nondestructive device characterization can be performed with this technique in realistic and even commercial cell designs.",8
"Peculiarities of the formation of a reticular polymeric gel-electrolyte matrix based on polyethylene glycol diacrylate in a medium of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tet-rafluoroborate (EMIBF4) were studied by isothermal calorimetry. The influence of the polymeric matrix structure on the ionic and molecular mobility of a LiBF4 salt-ionic liquid electrolyte system was considered. The self-diffusion coefficients on the H-1, Li-7, and F-19 nuclei were measured by pulsed field gradient NMR. For the all electrolyte compositions, the highest translation mobility of the cationic part of the EMI+ ionic liquid molecule is observed on 1H nuclei, whereas the lowest one corresponds to Li-7 nuclei. This phenomena is due to the strong association of the lithium salt in a polar medium of the ionic liquid, which is concentrated in cavities of the reticular polymer.",0
"Time-of-flight-elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) with 20 MeV Cu ions has been applied to measure the depth profiles of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on the negative electrode of lithium ion batteries (LIB). In order to obtain quantitative depth profiles, the detector efficiency was first assessed, and the test highlighted a strong mass and energy dependence of the recoiled particles, especially H and He. Subsequently, we prepared LIB cells with different water contents in the electrolyte, and subjected them to different charge-discharge cycle tests. TOF-ERDA, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), gas chromatography (GC), ion chromatography (IC), and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) were applied to characterize the SEI region of the negative electrode. The results showed that the SEI layer is formed after 300 cycle tests, and a 500 ppm water concentration in the electrolyte does not appear to cause significant differences in the elemental and organic content of the SEI.

"Instability of the lithium-manganese oxide, which has the spinel structure, in nonaqueous electrolyte solution was investigated. The lithium-manganese oxide powder samples were soaked in various kinds of nonaqueous electrolyte solutions at 85 degreesC for 4 days. The amount of manganese ions which were dissolved in the electrolyte solutions were analyzed by ICP-AES. The chemical state of the manganese ions in the solutions were identified by ESR From the results of ESR, it had been shown that the manganese ions formed at least three different formes of Mn-2 complexes in the nonaqueous electrolyte solution. The hydrolysis of the lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte in the nonaqueous electrolyte solutions were followed by P-31-NMR We suppose that the hydrofluoric acid, which was caused from the hydrolysis reaction of the lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte with trace amounts of water in the electrolyte solution or in lithium-manganese oxide powder, induced the solubility of manganese ions from lithium-manganese oxides.",0
"High-entropy alloys/compounds have large configurational entropy by introducing multiple components, showing improved functional properties that exceed those of conventional materials. However, how increasing entropy impacts the thermodynamic/kinetic properties in liquids that are ambiguous. Here we show this strategy in liquid electrolytes for rechargeable lithium batteries, demonstrating the substantial impact of raising the entropy of electrolytes by introducing multiple salts. Unlike all liquid electrolytes so far reported, the participation of several anionic groups in this electrolyte induces a larger diversity in solvation structures, unexpectedly decreasing solvation strengths between lithium ions and solvents/anions, facilitating lithium-ion diffusivity and the formation of stable interphase passivation layers. In comparison to the single-salt electrolytes, a low-concentration dimethyl ether electrolyte with four salts shows an enhanced cycling stability and rate capability. These findings, rationalized by the fundamental relationship between entropy-dominated solvation structures and ion transport, bring forward high-entropy electrolytes as a composition-rich and unexplored space for lithium batteries and beyond.Electrolytes, function as an ion conducting membrane between battery electrodes, are essential for rechargeable batteries. Here, the authors report high-entropy liquid electrolytes and reveal substantial impact of the increasing entropy on lithium-ion solvation structures for highly reversible lithium batteries.",0
"The aging stability of several Li2FeSiO4 (LFS) polymorphs in LiPF6-based organic carbonate solvent electrolyte at elevated temperature was investigated. The different LFS polymorphs were obtained by hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing at different temperatures. In addition, a carbon-coated sample was prepared. The samples were aged separately from each other at 60 degrees C in LiPF6-based organic electrolyte for 10 days and analyzed afterwards. The characterization of the residual powder by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveals a different aging behavior depending on the structure of the LFS polymorph. This influence of the polymorph on the stability of LFS powder against HF was confirmed by investigations of the aged electrolyte by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC).

"Understanding the ion-conduction mechanism in concentrated electrolyte solutions of Li salts is helpful in designing electrolytes for advanced Li batteries. In certain highly concentrated electrolytes, the Li+ ion hopping/ligand exchange mechanism contributes to ionic conduction, and the transference number of Li+ becomes higher than 0.5, which mitigates the concentration polarization in Li batteries. However, details of the hopping mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the temperature dependence of the transport properties of Li salt/ sulfolane (SL) electrolytes. Using pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found that Li+ ion diffuses faster than SL and anion in highly concentrated electrolytes, suggesting that Li+-ion-hopping conduction occurs. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the diffusivity of Li+ in highly concentrated electrolytes is slightly lower than Ea of the fluidity of liquid, which indicates that Li+-ion conduction is partially decoupled from the viscosity. The ratio of the actual molar conductivity to the calculated one based on the Nernst-Einstein relationship increases with decrease in temperature, leading to a lower Ea for ionic conduction compared to that of the fluidity and the ion diffusivity.",14
"The electrolyte solutions of 1 M LiBF4 dissolved in ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)/sulfone mixtures are applied for dual-ion batteries using graphite positive electrodes. The representative sulfone solvents include sulfolane (SL) and 3-methylsulfolane, Graphite electrodes can deliver higher capacity of anion storage in the solutions of the mixed solvents than those of pure solvents. Traditional electrochemical and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements are performed on Li/graphite cells to probe the anion intercalation process at the interface between graphite electrode and electrolyte solutions. Ionic conductivity, viscosity, and NMR tests are carried out to characterize electrolyte solutions. The effects of ion-pairing between Li+ and BF4- and the anion solvations by EMC or sulfones on the anion storage in graphite have been addressed.",0
"Despite large research efforts in the fields of lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, there are still unanswered questions. One of them is the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-metal-anode-based battery systems. Until now, a compound profile analysis of the SEI on lithium metal was challenging as the amounts of many compounds after simple contact of lithium metal and the electrolyte were too low for detection with analytical methods. This study presents a novel approach on unravelling the SEI compound profile through accumulation in the gas, liquid electrolyte, and solid phase. The method uses the intrinsic behavior of lithium metal to spontaneously react with the liquid electrolyte. In combination with complementary, state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and methods, this approach provides qualitative and quantitative results on all three phases revealing the vast variety of compounds formed in carbonate-based electrolytes.",0
"In the context of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery technology, LiNO3 is known to improve performance by protecting the lithium anode via the formation of an optimized solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as suppressing the associated lithium polysulfides shuttle effect during cycling. Herein, the concentration of added LiNO3 (0.05-0.4 mol kg(-1)) in a C(4)mpyr-TFSI-organic mixed electrolyte has been varied, with any changes in cell performance monitored against the physical (viscosity) and ion-transport (NMR-based ion diffusion and conductivity) properties of each variant. We find that an electrolyte with 0.1 molkri LiNO3 shows the best performance and that this is because this electrolyte has the highest conductivity, lowest viscosity and shows the lowest glass transition temperature (T-g), measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). While the long-term benefits of adding lithium nitrate to the electrolyte of Li-S cells are known to be related to effects centred on the lithium anode, the short-term influence of this additive on capacity performance is clearly related to promoting better access to the porous cathode. The range of concentration over which this effect is operative (0.05-0.20 mol k(g-1)) overlaps with the range recommended for optimum performance of the lithium anode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Increasing battery energy density is greatly desired for applications such as portable electronics and transportation. However, many next-generation batteries are limited by electrolyte selection because high ionic conductivity and poor electrochemical stability are typically observed in most electrolytes. For example, ether-based electrolytes have high ionic conductivity but are oxidatively unstable above 4 V, which prevents the use of high-voltage cathodes that promise higher energy densities. In contrast, hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) have high oxidative stability but do not dissolve lithium salt. In this work, we synthesize a new class of fluorinated ether electrolytes that combine the oxidative stability of HFEs with the ionic conductivity of ethers in a single compound. We show that conductivities of up to 2.7 x 10(-4) S/cm (at 30 degrees C) can be obtained with oxidative stability up to 5.6 V. The compounds also show higher lithium transference numbers compared to typical ethers. Furthermore, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) to study their ionic transport behavior and ion solvation environment, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that this new class of electrolytes can be used with a Ni-rich layered cathode (NMC 811) to obtain over 100 cycles at a C/5 rate. The design of new molecules with high ionic conductivity and high electrochemical stability is a novel approach for the rational design of next-generation batteries.",16
"A family of organophosphorus compounds including triphenyl phosphite (TPP), trimethyl phosphite (TMP), tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphite (TFEP), and tris(trimethylsily1) phosphite (TMSP) is investigated as additives for the stabilization of high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode-electrolyte interface. Our investigation reveals that the cycling performance of Li/LNMO half cells with the TMP, TFEP or TMSP additive is drastically improved at 60 degrees C compared to the baseline electrolyte. Among the various phosphite-based additives tested, TMSP additive enables facile Li ion transport at high C rates and significantly enhances the storage performance of the Li/LNMO cells at 60 degrees C. To understand the effects of the phosphite-based additives on electrolyte oxidative decomposition at high voltages, the surface chemistry of the cathode after precycling is investigated via ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the roles of phosphite-based additives to suppress LiPF6 hydrolysis and to remove HE are examined via F-19 and P-31 NMR spectroscopies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",9
"A new desolvated gel electrolyte (DGE) is investigated for its use in lithium metal sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S-PAN) battery. Lithium dendrite growth is examined under the DGE by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrolyte desolvation is analyzed with IR and H-1 NMR spectra as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculation using Gaussian09 package. The electrochemical performance of S-PAN cathode is compared under the DGE and a common electrolyte via galvanostatic charge/discharge. The growth mode of Li dendrite is schematically illustrated to elucidate the role of the DGE during the charge/discharge process. It is shown that the DGE can prevent the growth of dendrite from the Li anode surface. A specific capacity of 1276 mAh/g is retained under the DGE after 50 cycles at 60 mA/g current rate. It is indicated that the as-prepared gel electrolyte is desolvated, which is also confirmed with the theoretical calculation. The DGE weakens the solvation effect of the lithium ions and reduces the resistance of charge transfer at cathode/electrolyte interface; it increases lithium ion transference number as well, so enhancing the electrochemical performance of the cathode.",2
"Electrolytes of a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), trimethyl(isobutyl) phosphonium (P-111i4) bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) with a wide range of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI) salt concentrations (up to 3.8 mol kg(-1) of salt in the RTIL) were characterised using a combination of techniques including viscosity, conductivity, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). We show that the FSI-based electrolyte containing a high salt concentration (e.g. 1:1 salt to IL molar ratio, equivalent to 3.2 mol kg(-1) of LiFSI) displays unusual transport behavior with respect to lithium ion mobility and promising electrochemical behavior, despite an increase in viscosity. These electrolytes could compete with the more traditionally studied nitrogen-based ionic liquids (ILs) in lithium battery applications.",8

"Development of Mg electrolytes that can plate/strip Mg is not trivial and remains one of the major roadblocks to advance Mg battery research. Halogen-free electrolyte has attracted great attention due to its high stability, less corrosive nature and compatibility with Mg metal anodes. However, the electrochemical properties of such electrolytes have not been analytically evaluated in the literature. Herein, we report a systematic study of the concentration-dependent electrochemical and mass transport properties of a non-aqueous, halogen-free Mg electrolyte composed of magnesium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide in diglyme (Mg(TFSI)(2)/G2). Specifically, cyclic voltammograms confirm that plating and stripping of Mg in Mg(TFSI)(2)/G2 electrolyte occur over a wide concentration range. Results suggest a comparably difficult magnesium dissolution in Mg(TFSI)(2)/G2 electrolyte in contrast to in Grignard based electrolytes. Dissolution overpotential shows a non-monotonic dependence on electrolyte concentration, it requires an similar to 2 V overpotential to deposit Mg. Findings also reveal concentration-dependent mass transport properties, including concentration-dependent electrolyte diffusivity and transference number. The atomic environment of the Mg(TFSI)(2)/G2, as being further explored by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurement and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, is coupled with the electrochemical measurements to explain the observed concentration-dependent mass transport properties.",9

"Identifying a suitable electrode material with desirable electrochemical properties remains a primary challenge for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Recently an ultrafast rechargeable Al-ion battery was reported with high charge/discharge rate, (relatively) high discharge voltage and high capacity that uses a graphite-based cathode. Using calculations from first-principles, we have investigated the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into bulk graphite and evaluated the stability, specific capacity and voltage profile of AlCl4 intercalated compounds. Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of ∼0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01–2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g−1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.",5
"With the rapid consumption of fossil energy, the development of renewable energy storage technology has received much attention. Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) are expected to constitute large-scale energy storage systems because of the aluminum resources’richness and low cost. Therefore it is necessary to study the new type of RAIBs positive electrode material, but there is not a systematic design principle now. It is noted that SnSe, as a novel positive electrode material of aluminum-ion battery based on aluminium chloride/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AlCl3/[EMIm]Cl) room temperature ionic liquid electrolyte for the first time, exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 1.6 V and a high first cycle specific discharge capacity of 582 mAh g−1 (coulomb efficiency of 83.27%) at a current density of 0.3 A g−1. After 100 cycles, the specific discharge capacity can be maintained at 107 mAh g−1 (coulomb efficiency of 99.55%). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and constant current Charge/Discharge results show that the mechanism of the cell is the reaction between AlCl- 4 and SnSe, and both Sn2+ and Se2– participate in the oxidation–reduction reaction. Just from the high capacity point of view, the novel Al-ion battery based on the AlCl- 4 reaction mechanism can be a multi-ion reaction.",5
"An electrolyte capable of operating at room temperature has been developed for fluoride shuttle batteries, which are regarded as a promising type of high energy density batteries. This electrolyte uses a reasonably priced and widely available potassium salt called potassium bifluoride (KHF2) as the source of fluoride ions, propylene carbonate, which has a high dielectric constant, as the solvent, and the 18-crown-6 ether, which has a high dielectric constant, as the solvent, and the 18-crown-6 ether, which K is capable of dissolving potassium salts, as an additive. The ionic conductivity of this electrolyte reaches 1.72 mS cm(-1), which is sufficient to enable the operation of fluoride shuttle batteries. The charge/discharge test results using the bismuth fluoride (BiF3) electrode showed a discharge capacity of 263 mAh g(-1) and a charge capacity of 184 mAh g(-1). By the measurement of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the state of the fluoride ions in the electrolyte is determined to be [(FH)F](-). It is considered that hydrogen fluoride (HF) generated by the equilibration reactions of [(FH)F](-) dissolves metal fluorides that act as the active material of the electrodes, creating a mechanism that enhances the redox reaction of the metal fluorides.",1
"A flower-like vanadium sulfide/reduced graphene oxide (VS4/rGO) composite was prepared by a typical hydrothermal method and it was investigated as cathode for aluminum-ion batteries with non-inflammable and non-explosive ionic-liquid electrolytes. The charge/discharge performance measurements were performed in a voltage range of 0.1–2.0 V versus Al/AlCl4−, which gave an initial charge/discharge specific capacity af approximately 491.57 and 406.94 mA h g−1, respectively, at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Additionally, in the cycling performance, the discharge capacity was observed to remain over 80, 70, and 60 mA h g−1 at current densities of 100, 200, and 300 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively. The result of a coulombic efficiency over 90 % after 100 cycles and high retained capacity indicate that the composite is a favorable cathode material for new rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries.",5
"In this work, nonstoichiometric Cu2–xSe fabricated by a facile water evaporation process is used as high-performance Al-ion battery cathode materials.

The prominent kinetics of Cu2–xSe electrodes is also revealed by the GITT, which is attributed to the ultrahigh electronic conductivity of the Cu2–xSe material. Most importantly, an extensive research is dedicated to investigating the detailed intercalation and de-intercalation of relatively large chloroaluminate anions into the cubic Cu2–xSe, which is conducive to better understand the reaction mechanism of the Al/Cu2–xSe battery.",5
"Owing to the high abundance, inherent safety, and three-electron redox properties of aluminum, aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are promising candidates for the next-generation battery technologies with high energy-to-price ratio. Despite recent great progress in finding appropriate electrolyte, an on-going research focus of the AIBs remains to be exploiting host electrodes for the large aluminum (complex) ions. Herein, a star-shaped two-dimensional (2D) WS2 microsheet assembly cathode substitute is prepared and applied in AIBs for the first time. The in-depth study with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals an explicit intercalation mechanism of chloroaluminate anions (AlCl4−) in the WS2 electrode.

"The Karl Fischer titration is the standard method for the determination of the water content in many materials. However, in particular cases, unwanted side reactions occur which leads to unacceptably large errors. We present here an nuclear magnetron resonance (NMR)-based method for the determination of trace impurities of water in a salt recently developed for lithium ion cells, i.e., lithium bis[1,2-oxalato(2-)-O,O']borate (LiBOB). The method, which may be applied to many lithium salts used in batteries, is able to determine traces of water in the salt down to similar to 6 ppm. Errors depend strongly on the salt studied. Deviations from expected values obtained by standard addition were 28% for LiBOB, 4% for LiPF6, and 6% for LiClO4 . Using the error propagation law, we estimated an overall error of about 10%.

"Conventional electrolytes made by mixing simple Mg2+ salts and aprotic solvents, analogous to those in Li-ion batteries, are incompatible with Mg anodes because Mg metal readily reacts with such electrolytes, producing a passivation layer that blocks Mg2+ transport. Here, we report that, through tuning a conventional electrolyte-Mg(TFSI)(2) (TEST- is N(SO2CF3)(2)(-))-with an Mg(BH4)(2) cosalt, highly reversible Mg plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency is achieved by neutralizing the first solvation shell of Mg cationic clusters between Mg2+ and TFSI- and enhanced reductive stability of free MI-. A critical adsorption step between Mg-0 atoms and active Mg cation clusters involving BH4- anions is identified to be the key enabler for reversible Mg plating/stripping through analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) from operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), operando electrochemical Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",2
"The mobility and solvation of lithium ions in electrolytes are crucial for the performance and safety of lithium ion batteries. It has been known that a single type of solvent cannot satisfy the requirements of both mobility and solvation simultaneously for electrolytes. Therefore, complex solvent mixtures have been used to optimize both properties. Here we present the effects of density on the dynamics and solvation of organic liquid electrolytes via extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Our study finds that a small variation in density can induce a significant effect on the mobility of electrolytes but does not influence the solvation structure of a lithium ion. It turns out that an adjustment of the density of electrolytes could provide a more effective way to enhance mobility than a control of the solvent mixture ratio of electrolytes. Our study reveals that the density change of electrolytes mainly affects the residence time of solvents in the first solvation shell of a lithium ion rather than the structural change of the solvation sheath. Finally, our results suggest an intriguing point for understanding and designing electrolytes of lithium ion batteries for better performance and safety.",0
"The investigation of ion-solvent interaction in electrolytes is crucial for basic understanding of ion transport through the bulk electrolyte as well as interphase formation processes on both electrodes, which dictate performances of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this report, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to study the solvation behaviors of two typical lithium salts (lithium hexafluorophosphate, or LiPF6, and lithium tetrafluoroborate, or LiBF4) dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) mixtures. With increasing salt concentration and DMC percentage in both systems, F-19 NMR experiences an upfield shift along with decreasing J(31p-19F) and J(11B-19F), which evidence the stronger interaction between the Li+ and F- in an environment with diminishing presence of high dielectric medium. The quadrupolar relaxation of B-11 dominates the F-19 relaxation mechanism and demonstrates that LiBF4 mainly exists as ion pairs in solution either at high salt concentration or in a medium of low polarity. Li-7, F-19, H-1 NMR diffusion measurements were conducted to characterize the relative mobility of cation, anion and solvent molecules, the results of which support the conclusion above. Salt concentration and solution polarity have a much stronger effect on cation-anion aggregation and solvation in the LiBF4 system than in the LiPF6 system.",0
"Electrolytes with a high lithium transference number linked with high ionic conductivity are urgently needed for high power battery operation.

We employ impedance spectroscopy in symmetric Li/electrolyte/Li cells and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the lithium conduction mechanism. We find predominant lithium conductivity with very high lithium transference numbers (similar to 70% from the polarization experiments) and three times higher ionic conductivity compared to well-known lithium triflate in diglyme electrolyte. This is a consequence of the reduced mobilities of large anions linked with improved ionic dissociation.",16
"Histidine, inspired by vanadium bromoperoxidase enzyme, has been applied as a homogeneous electrocatalyst to the positive electrolyte of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) to improve the performance and stability of VRFB at elevated temperatures. The histidine-containing electrolyte is found to significantly improve the performance of VRFB in terms of thermal stability estimated by the remaining amount of VO2+ in the electrolyte (61 vs 43% of a pristine one), energy efficiency at a high current density of 150 mA cm(-2) (78.7 vs 71.2%), and capacity retention (73.2 vs 27.7%) at 60 degrees C. The mechanism of the catalytic functions of histidine with the chemical species in the electrolyte has been investigated for the first time by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The analyzed data reveal that histidine improves the kinetics of both charge and discharge reactions through different affinity toward the reactants and products as well as suppresses the precipitation of VO2+ by impeding the polymerization of vanadium ions. These findings are in good agreement with the improved chemical and electrochemical performance of the histidine-containing VRFB. Our results show a new type of chemical/electrochemical mechanism in the improved redox flow battery performance that may be essential in a new research arena for better performance of electrochemical systems.",9
"Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)-based electrolytes are prepared by dissolving the PAMAM half-generations G1.5 or G2.5 in propylene carbonate (PC), either with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) or sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) salts. The solutions, designed for ion battery applications, are studied in terms of ions transport properties. Raman Spectroscopy reveals information about the interactions between cations and PAMAM dendrimers as well as full dissociation of the salts in all solutions. Pulsed-field gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (PFG NMR), measured as a function of both temperature and PAMAM concentration, are obtained for the cation, anion, solvent, and dendrimer molecules using lithium (Li-7), sodium (Na-23), fluorine (F-19), and hydrogen (H-1) NMR, respectively. It was found that lithium diffusion is slow compared to the larger TFSI anion and decreases with PAMAM concentration due to interactions between cation and dendrimer. Comparison of conductivities calculated from diffusion coefficients using the Nernst-Einstein equation, with conductivity measurements obtained from Impedance Spectroscopy (IS), shows slightly higher IS conductivities, caused among others by PAMAM conductivity.",10
"Catholyte in all-vanadium redox-flow battery (VRFB) which consists of vanadium salts dissolved in sulphuric acid is known to be stabilized by phosphoric acid to slow down the thermal aging at temperatures higher than 40 degrees C. To reveal the role of phosphoric acid, the thermally-induced aggregation is investigated using variable-temperature V-51, P-31, O-17, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results indicate that the thermal stabilization of vanadium(V) electrolyte is attained by the involvement of monomeric and dimeric vanadium(V) species in the reaction with phosphoric acid which is concurrent to the formation of neutral hydroxo-aqua vanadium(V) precipitation precursor. The dimers are stabilized by counter ions due to association reaction or if such stabilization is not possible, precipitation of vanadium pentoxide is favored. The evolution of particles size distributions at 50 degrees C in electrolyte samples containing 1.6 M vanadium and 4.0 M total sulphate and the pathways of precipitate formation are discussed. The optimal total phosphate concentration is found to be of 0.15 M. However, the induction time is assumed to be dependent not only on the total phosphate concentrations, but also on the ratio of total vanadium(V) to sulphate concentrations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Understanding the solvation structures of electrolytes is important for developing nonaqueous redox flow batteries that hold considerable potential for future large scale energy storage systems. The utilization of an emerging ionic-derivatived ferrocene compound, ferrocenylmethyl dimethyl ethyl ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Fc1N112-TFSI), has recently overcome the issue of solubility in the supporting electrolyte. In this work, C-13, H-1 and O-17 NMR investigations were carried out using electrolyte solutions consisting of Fc1N112-TFSI as the solute and the mixed alkyl carbonate as the solvent. It was observed that the spectra of C-13 experience changes of chemical shifts while those of O-17 undergo linewidth broadening, indicating interactions between solute and solvent molecules. Quantum chemistry calculations of both molecular structures and chemical shifts (C-13, H-1 and O-17) are performed for interpreting experimental results and for understanding the detailed solvation structures. The results indicate that Fc1N112-TFSI is dissociated at varying degrees in mixed solvent depending on concentrations. At dilute solute concentrations, most Fc1N112(+) and TFSI- are fully disassociated with their own solvation shells formed by solvent molecules. At saturated concentration, Fc1N112(+)-TFSI- contact ion pairs are formed and the solvent molecules are preferentially interacting with the Fc rings rather than interacting with the ionic pendant arm of Fc1N112-TFSI.

"The electrolyte of a used lithium-ion battery from a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) was investigated. The liquid electrolyte was collected through the pressure valve of these 5 Ah cells. It consists of (29.8 +/- 0.2) wt.% dimethyl carbonate (DMC), (21.7 +/- 0.1) wt.% ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), (30.3 +/- 0.3) wt.% ethylene carbonate (EC) and (2.2 +/- 0.1) wt.% cyclohexyl benzene (CHB) which were identified with GC-MS and quantified with GC-FID. Li+ (1.29 +/- 0.04) mol L-1 and PF6- were determined with IC as the main ionic species in the solution. Furthermore, BF4- was clearly identified with IC-ESI-MS, IC-ICP-MS and B-11 NMR and quantified to a concentration of (120.8 +/- 8.3) mg L-1 with ICP-OES. The presence of POF3 (detected with GC-MS), F-, PO2F2-, HPO3F- and H2PO4- (determined with IC-ESI-MS) can be attributed to the reaction of the conducting salt LiPF6 via PF5 with traces of water. HPO3F- and H2PO4-, could only be observed in cells which were opened in a laboratory hood under exposure of air humidity. This experiment was done to simulate escaping electrolyte from an HEV battery pack. Furthermore, several alkyl phosphates (identified with GC-MS and IC-ESI-MS) are present in the solution due to further reaction of the different fluorinated phosphates with organic carbonates.

"Three classes of dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) were synthesized, in which the cationic species [N-methyl pyrrolidinium (MPy), N-butyl imidazolium (Blm) or diethylsulfide (DES)] were separated with oligoether moieties. The counter anions are either dicyanamide (DCA) or bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (TFSI). The molecular structures of these compounds were identified by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and( 13)C NMR analysis. The DILs were investigated for their potential as electrolyte solvents. Thermal behaviors were also studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showing excellent thermal stability up to 150 degrees C for all DILs. Their physicochemical properties were comprehensively characterized regarding their densities, melting points, viscosities, and miscibility with polar and nonpolar solvents. To compensate high viscosity limitation of DILs, two low viscosity ionic liquids (thinners), [MImEt] (DCA] and [MImEt] [TFSI] were used. To further improve the lithium ion conduction ability of the electrolyte systems, a lithium salt (LiTFSI) was added. Then several ternary electrolyte systems, LiTFSI in DILs/thinner (the weight ratio of DILs/thinner was fixed equal to 1/1) were developed, and their ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability were analyzed.

"Sulfones are polar molecules that can be used as thermally stable electrolyte solvents for Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Li salts form stoichiometric solvates with sulfones in the electrolytes. The melting points of the solvates tend to be higher than room temperature, thereby limiting the operating temperature range of the batteries. In this study, the applicability of ternary eutectic mixtures of LiN(SO2F)(2) (LiFSA), sulfolane (SL), and dimethyl sulfone (DMS) as LIB electrolytes was assessed. Relative to the binary LiFSA-sulfone electrolytes, the ternary eutectic electrolytes remained liquid over a wide temperature range due to the increased entropy of mixing. Sulfone-bridged Li+-sulfone-Li+ and anion-bridged Li+-FSA(-)-Li+ network structures were formed in the eutectic electrolyte with a composition of [LiFSA]/[SL]/[DMS] = 1/1.5/1.5. Pulsed-field gradient NMR measurements revealed that the Li+ ion dynamically exchanges sulfones and anions and diffuses more rapidly than these ligands, resulting in the relatively high Li+ transference number of the electrolyte. Highly reversible charge-discharge processes of the LiCoO2 and graphite electrodes were attained using the ternary eutectic electrolyte. The rate capability of the Li/LiCoO2 cell in the eutectic electrolyte was comparable to that of the cell in the conventional 1 M LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate solution despite its lower ionic conductivity.",0
"Novel water-soluble methylated chitins (MCHs) were synthesized homogeneously in aqueous alkaline solution. The relatively mild reaction conditions resulted in the MCH with high degree of acetylation (DA >0.76). The chemical structure of the obtained MCHs was analyzed and the degree of methylation substitution (DS) and DA were determined by proton NMR in both D2O and 20% DCl/D2O. The MCH aqueous solutions (DS = 0.46 similar to 0.71) showed a reversible thermosensitive sol-gel-sol transition upon heating and cooling. The gel transition temperature of these MCHs (in the range of 15-85 degrees C) increased with increasing DS and decreasing polymer concentration. Thermal runaway has been an important safety issue impeding the development of high-energy-density zinc-ion batteries. A smart thermosensitive reversible electrolyte was prepared based on this MCH for the aqueous zinc-ion battery to prevent thermal runaway. When the temperature of zinc-ion battery rises or even gets out of control, the thermosensitive electrolyte can quickly gel and inhibit the migration of zinc ions, resulting in increase of the internal resistance and realizing intelligent and efficient thermal self-protection. Thus the novel thermosensitive methylated chitin shows promise for safe aqueous zinc-ion batteries.",15
"Functionalized disiloxane compounds were synthesized by attaching oligo(ethylene glycol) chains, -(CH2CH2O)-(n), n = 2-7, via hydrosilation, dehydrocoupling, and nucleophilic substitution reactions and were examined as non-aqueous electrolyte solvents in lithium-ion cells. The compounds were fully characterized by (1) H, C-13, and Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Upon doping with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) or LiPF6, the disiloxane electrolytes showed conductivities up to 6.2 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at room temperature. The thermal behavior of the electrolytes was studied by differential scanning calorimetry, which revealed very low glass transition temperatures before and after LiBOB doping and much higher thermal stability compared to organic carbonate electrolytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that disiloxane-based electrolytes with 0.8 M LiBOB salt concentration are stable to 4.7 V. The LiBOB/disiloxane combinations were found to be good electrolytes for lithium-ion cells; unlike LiPF6, LiBOB can provide a good passivation film on the graphite anode. The LiPF6/disiloxane electrolyte was enabled in lithium-ion cells by adding 1 wt% vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC). Full cell performance tests with LiNi0.80Co0.15Al0.05O2 as the cathode and mesocarbon microbead (MCMB) graphite as the anode show stable cyclability. The results demonstrate that disiloxane-based electrolytes have considerable potential as electrolytes for use in lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"The trend toward Li-ion batteries operating at increased (>4.3 V vs. Li/Li+) voltages requires the development of novel classes of lithium electrolytes with electrochemical stability windows exceeding those of LiPF6/carbonate electrolyte solutions. Several new classes of electrolytes have been synthesized and investigated over the past decade, in the search for LIB electrolytes with improved properties (increased hydrolytic stability, improved thermal abuse tolerance, higher oxidation voltages, etc.) compared with the present state-of-the-art LiPF6 and organic carbonates-based formulations. Among these are deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs), which share many beneficial characteristics with ionic liquids, such as low vapor pressure and large electrochemical stability windows, with the added advantage of a significantly higher lithium transference number. The present work presents the pulsed field gradient NMR characterization of the transport properties (diffusion coefficients and cation transport numbers) of binary DEEs consisting of a sulfonamide solvent and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt. Insights into the structural and dynamical properties, which enable one to rationalize the observed ionic conductivity behavior were obtained from a combination of NMR data and MD simulations. The insights thus gained should assist the formulation of novel DEEs with improved properties for LIB applications.",10
"Investigation of electrode/electrolyte interface of 5V spinet material LiNi0.4Mn1.6O4 was carried out in the presence of glutaric anhydride additive, using combined magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. After exposure to LiPF6 in EC/DMC liquid electrolyte, oxidation state of +III or lower has been evidenced by EELS for Mn ions, indicating that the presence of glutaric anhydride additive in the electrolyte, not only modifies the interphase, but does not prevent chemical reactions with the active material. Further investigation of the influence of the additive upon storage and cycling was performed using combined Li-7 and F-19 MAS NMR. The native interphase formed by simple contact of the active material with the electrolyte is partially destroyed at high potential but the new appearing interphase is overall increasing upon cycling, independently from the presence of glutaric anhydride. The use of glutaric anhydride is nevertheless beneficial as it clearly restrains the formation of lithiated interphasial species and alters the interphase composition since the formation of fluorophosphates is promoted, lowering the relative amount of resistive LiF. Although resistive LiF can be formed in significant amount, it is removed by the DMC rinsing while fluorophosphates display a stronger adherence to the active material. (C) 2012 Elsevier RV.

"The consumption via reductive and oxidative decompositions of vinylene carbonate (VC) molecules as an electrolyte additive at the anode and cathode in a 18650 lithium-ion battery was quantitatively analyzed with charge-discharge tests, NMR spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. It was unambiguously concluded that the molar number of VC reductively decomposed at the anode has the upper limit whereas that of VC oxidatively decomposed at the cathode depended highly upon the initial VC concentration. The excess amount of VC molecules causes the increase in oxidative decomposition at the cathode surface eventually reducing the Columbic efficiency at the first cycle. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

"A series of butyrolactone derivatives with various side chains mainly at the 5-position were used as additives in 1 M LiClO4-propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries with graphite anodes. When more than 0.3 M of 2-acetyloxy-4,4-dimethyl-4-butanolide (AcBL1) was added to 1 M LiClO4-PC solution, exfoliation of graphite, co-intercalation and decomposition of PC was suppressed and lithium insertion and extraction into/from graphite anode proceeded. C-13 NMR measurements suggested that the suppression of PC co-intercalation and decomposition was due to the decrease of the number of PC molecules coordinated to the lithium ion and increase of AcBLI coordination. Addition of butyrolactone derivatives with acetoxyl or carbonate groups at the 5-position into 1 M LiClO4-C solution led to better charge-discharge anode performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

"The high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel cathode material offers high energy density storage capabilities without the use of costly Co that is prevalent in other Li-ion battery chemistries (e.g., LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC)). Unfortunately, LNMO-containing batteries suffer from poor cycling performance because of the intrinsically coupled processes of electrolyte oxidation and transition metal dissolution that occurs at high voltage. In this work, we use operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to demonstrate that transition metal dissolution in LNMO is tightly coupled to HF formation (and thus, electrolyte oxidation reactions as detected with operando and in situ solution NMR), indicative of an acid-driven disproportionation reaction that occurs during delithiation (i.e., battery charging). Leveraging the temporal resolution (s-min) of magnetic resonance, we find that the LNMO particles accelerate the rate of LiPF6 decomposition and subsequent Mn2+ dissolution, possibly due to the acidic nature of terminal Mn-OH groups. X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) provides surface-sensitive and localized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, in addition to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), that indicate disproportionation is enabled by surface reconstruction upon charging, which leads to surface Mn3+ sites on the LNMO particle surface that can disproportionate into Mn-(dissolved)(2+) and Mn-(s)(4+). During discharge of the battery, we observe high quantities of metal fluorides (in particular, MnF2) in the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on LNMO as well as the conductive carbon additives in the composite. Electronic conductivity measurements indicate that the MnF2 decreases film conductivity by threefold compared to LiF, suggesting that this CEI component may impede both the ionic and electronic properties of the cathode. Ultimately, to prevent transition metal dissolution and the associated side reactions in spinel-type cathodes (particularly those that operate at high voltages like LNMO), the use of electrolytes that offer improved anodic stability and prevent acid byproducts will likely be necessary.",9
"Polythiophene (PTH) was prepared by the chemical polymerization of thiophene under ambient, solvent-free conditions in the presence of FeCl3. This PTH was characterized by FTIR, UV-vis, NMR, and XRD. The NMR spectrum showed a PTH oligomer consisting of both aromatic thiophene and hydrogen-saturated tetrahydrothiophene moieties. The insoluble PITH was studied as a cathode active material for rechargeable lithium batteries with LiN(CF3SO2)(2) (LiTFSI), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) as electrolytes. Charge-discharge tests were conducted at room temperature. The discharge specific capacity, for levels above 400 mA h g(-1), was obtained. The detected stable specific capacity and isolated, conjugated structure indicate that the charge-discharge mechanism was different from a classical 'doping-dedoping' process. We tentatively propose that the high specific capacity of PTH results from multi-electron electrode reactions on S atoms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",9
"Graphite is used in the lithium-ion batteries as a negative electrode. We use continuous, in situ, operando Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to show, in real time, the progressive intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium in graphite when a battery is charged and discharged. We obtain all the Li-graphite intercalation compound stages through an electrochemical path. We explain the overvoltages by transient entropic and Peltier effects. The sample is a plastic cell, NMR compatible, made of commercial graphite, commercial electrolyte and lithium metal foil. We analyze the NMR characteristics of the Li-GIC stages: line shift, quadrupolar frequencies, line width (Li diffusion), line intensity and area as a function of x = Li/C-6. This allows us to estimate the lithium quantities in each stage at each step. Two facts differ from the theoretical stage n formation: for the C/20 cycling rate, we find an hysteresis in the filling/emptying of the dilute (LiC(9)n) stages, and we find another NMR line synchronous with LiC6. The lithium metal line also provides quantitative information on the lithium deposited as dendrites when x diminishes, in de-intercalation. This paper presents experimental NMR data over two cycles, and is an extension of the first cycle analysis published earlier. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",9
"The lithium-ion batteries are widely used in rechargeable electronic devices. The current challenges are to improve the capacity and safety of these systems in view of their development to a larger scale, such as for their application in electric and hybrid vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries use organic solvents because of the wide operating voltage. The corresponding electrolytes are usually based on combinations of linear, cyclic alkyl carbonates and a lithium salt such as LiPF6. It has been reported that in abusive thermal conditions, a catalytic effect of the cathode materials lead to the formation fluoro-organics compounds. In order to understand the degradation phenomenon, the study at 240 C-circle of the interaction between positive electrode materials (LiCoO2, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2, LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4) and electrolyte in dry and wet conditions has been realized by an original method which consists in analyzing by mass spectrometry in real time the volatile molecules produced. The evolution of specific gases channels coupled to the NMR reveal the formation of rarely discussed species such as 2-fluoroethanol and 1,4-dioxane. Furthermore, it appears that the presence of water or other protic impurities greatly influence their formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
The temperature dependence of Li-ion transport is explored in novel stoichiometric chalcogenide glasses in the ternary system Li2S-Ga2Se3-GeSe2 using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The dc conductivity in these glasses monotonically increases with Li2S content with the highest room-temperature conductivity being similar to 10(-4) S/cm in the glass of composition: 50% Li2S-10% Ga2Se3-40% GeSe2 with an activation energy of 0.37 eV. Analysis of the Li-7 NMR central transition line shape reveals that Li ions are randomly distributed in the structure of these glasses and their rapid hopping transport is responsible for the electrical conductivity. The excellent agreement between the experimentally measured dc conductivity and that calculated from the Li-ion hopping frequency obtained from EIS and NMR implies that the ionic transference number in all glasses is close to unity and these glasses behave as strong electrolytes.,0
"The benchmark magnesium electrolyte, [Mg2Cl3](+) [AlPh4](-), can be prepared in a 100% atom-economic fashion by a ligand exchange reaction between AlCl3 and two molar equivalents of MgPh2.

Electrochemical performance has been validated by polarisation tests and cyclic voltammetry, which demonstrate excellent stability of electrolytes produced via this atom-efficient approach.",0
"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and 1H NMR spectroscopy were performed to gain a complementary understanding of the concentrated Li-ion electrolyte system, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) dissolved in tetraglyme. The computational methods provided the concentration dependence of differing solvation structure motifs by reference to changes in the corresponding NMR spectra. By combining both the computational and experimental methodologies, we show that the various solvation structures, dominated by the coordination between the tetraglyme (G4) solvent and lithium cation, directly influence the chemical shift separation of resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of the solvent. Thus, the 1H NMR spectra can be used to predict the fraction of tetraglyme involved in the solvation process, with quantitative agreement with solvation fraction predictions from MD simulation snapshots. Overall, our results demonstrate the reliability of a hybrid computational and experimental methodology to understand the solvation structure and hence transport mechanism of LiTFSI-G4 electrolytes in the low concentration region.",13
"The ever-growing demands for energy storage motivate the development of high-performance batteries. Rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries get increasing attractions due to their remarkable performance, high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the research is in the early stage with challenges that hinder the road of commercialization, such as the unsatisfactory utilization of active materials and poor stability. Recently, some excellent works are performed to boost the development of alkaline Zn batteries from the electrode optimization to electrolyte exploration and structure design. Herein, this article provides a timely spotlight on the breakthroughs in the performance and structure of well-developed Zn batteries such as Zn–Ag and Zn–Ni batteries, as well as some new types of Zn batteries like Zn–Co, Zn–Cu, and Zn–Bi batteries.

"Zinc (Zn) metal was used in the very first battery, the Voltaic pile, invented by Alessandro Volta in 1799. As a classic anode material, many types of primary Zn batteries (Zn–air, Zn–MnO2, Zn–NiOOH and Zn–Ag2O) have been successfully commercialized, and most of them are still in use today. However, the development of rechargeable Zn-based batteries has proceeded slowly, mostly because of the poor reversibility of Zn chemistry in aqueous electrolytes1. In recent years, the market share of Zn batteries has shrunk significantly due to the success of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, LIB safety issues, which originate from the non-aqueous and highly flammable electrolytes used therein, have caused public concern. In addition, the large-scale application of LIBs in electric vehicles and grid storage systems has also sharply driven up the price of raw materials used in LIBs, such as nickel and cobalt, as well as lithium salts, casting doubts over the sustainability of LIBs for future energy storage2,3. In this context, revisiting the aqueous battery systems and making them rechargeable becomes attractive. The Zn battery in particular is a good alternative as aqueous Zn batteries promise high capacity (5,854 Ah l–1 and 820 mAh g–1) and low cost, and are intrinsically safe. Unfortunately, however, the irreversibility of the Zn metal anode during charge–discharge cycling, as well as the dendritic growth of Zn metal during cycling4, leads to poor Coulombic efficiency and rechargeability. In order to compensate for the loss of active Zn, extra Zn has to be used, which results in much lower practical energy density.",12
"Rechargeable zinc metal batteries (RZMBs) offer a compelling complement to existing lithium ion and emerging lithium metal batteries for meeting the increasing energy storage demands of the future. Multiple recent reports have suggested that optimized electrolytes resolve a century-old challenge for RZMBs by achieving extremely reversible zinc plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) approaching 100%. However, the disparity among published testing methods and conditions severely convolutes electrolyte performance comparisons. The lack of rigorous and standardized protocols is rapidly becoming an impediment to ongoing research and commercialization thrusts. This Perspective examines recent efforts to improve the reversibility of the zinc metal anode in terms of key parameters, including CE protocols, plating morphology, dendrite formation and long-term stability. Then we suggest the most appropriate standard protocols for future CE determination. Finally, we envision future strategies to improve zinc/electrolyte stability so that research efforts can be better aligned towards realistic performance targets for RZMB commercialization.",12
"Zinc-based batteries are experiencing a resurgence in interest owing to their promising energy and power metrics, and inherent safety advantages compared with lithium-ion batteries. As scientists worldwide address the remaining obstacles to realizing competitive performance across the family of zinc batteries, the enthusiasm to report new ‘‘breakthroughs’’ at the materials or small-device level must be tempered by a realistic understanding of how such improvements will translate to practical energy-storage devices. Framing early-stage results in such a context will advance the prospects of next-generation Zn batteries while avoiding the ‘‘hype cycle’’ that has plagued research and development for other energy-storage technologies.

"Aluminum is an ideal material for metallic fuel cells. In this research, different grain sizes of aluminum anodes are prepared by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) at room temperature. Microstructure of the anodes is examined by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in scanning electron microscope (SEM). Hydrogen corrosion rates of the Al anodes in 4 mol L−1 NaOH are determined by hydrogen collection method. The electrochemical properties of the aluminum anodes are investigated in the same electrolyte using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization curves. Battery performance is also tested by constant current discharge at different current densities. Results confirm that the electrochemical properties of the aluminum anodes are related to grain size.

"To develop new materials for Al/air batteries, the evaluation and characterisation of commercial aluminium alloys, namely, Al2000, Al2000Clad and Al7000, as anodes in alkaline electrolyte batteries has been performed. Their self-corrosion rate, hydrogen evolution rate and electrochemical properties, including open circuit potentials, polarisation characteristics and potentiodynamic measurements, were examined in a 4 M KOH solution. Among the tested alloys, Al2000 was found to be the most promising because it exhibits a high open circuit potential, a good anode efficiency and a minimum corrosion rate. Al2000/NiOOH and Al2000/air batteries were tested. Electrolyte concentrations between 0.01 and 4 M KOH were studied, and discharge currents between 0.8 and 20 mA cm−2 were imposed to analyse the evolution of the Ecell.

"Recently, MgTFSI2/MgCl2 electrolyte solutions in dimethoxyethane (DME) have been shown to function as viable electrolyte solutions for secondary Mg batteries that can facilitate reversible magnesium deposition/dissolution. MgCl2 is a crucial component in these solutions. On its own, however, it is practically insoluble in DME. Therefore, the fact that it is readily dissolved in MgTFSI2/DME solution is remarkable. Addition of MgCl2 greatly improves the electrochemical performance of MgTFSI2/DME electrolyte solutions. Thus, identifying the species formed in MgTFSI2/MgCl2 solutions is intriguing. In this study, we implemented a wide variety of analytical tools, including single crystal X-ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR, and Raman spectroscopy, to elucidate the structure of these solutions. Various solution species were determined, and a suitable reaction scheme is suggested.",1
"Owing to the development of aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), flexible ZIBs are deemed as potential candidates to power wearable electronics. ZIBs with solid-state polymer electrolytes can not only maintain additional load-bearing properties, but exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties by preventing dendrite formation and inhibiting cathode dissolution. Substantial efforts have been applied to polymer electrolytes by developing solid polymer electrolytes, hydrogel polymer electrolytes, and hybrid polymer electrolytes; however, the research of polymer electrolytes for ZIBs is still immature. Herein, the recent progress in polymer electrolytes is summarized by category for flexible ZIBs, especially hydrogel electrolytes, including their synthesis and characterization. Aiming to provide an insight from lab research to commercialization, the relevant challenges, device configurations, and life cycle analysis are consolidated. As flexible batteries, the majority of polymer electrolytes exploited so far only emphasizes the electrochemical performance but the mechanical behavior and interactions with the electrode materials have hardly been considered. Hence, strategies of combining softness and strength and the integration with electrodes are discussed for flexible ZIBs. A ranking index, combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties, is introduced. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward the commercialization of flexible ZIBs.",9
"Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have been gradually developed in recent years due to their abundant resources, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Therefore, ZIBs have received a great deal of attention from researchers, which are considered as the next generation of portable energy storage systems. However, poor overall performance of ZIBs restricts their development, which is attributed to zinc dendrites and a series of side reactions. Constructing 3D zinc anodes has proven to be an effective way to significantly improve their electrochemical performance. In this review, the challenges of zinc anodes in ZIBs, including zinc dendrites, hydrogen evolution and corrosion, as well as passivation, are comprehensively summarized and the energy storage mechanisms of the zinc anodes and 3D zinc anodes are discussed. 3D zinc anodes with different structures including fiberous, porous, ridge-like structures, plated zinc anodes on different substrates and other 3D zinc anodes, are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, emerging opportunities and perspectives on the material design of 3D zinc anodes are highlighted and challenges that need to be solved in future practical applications are discussed, hopefully illuminating the way forward for the development of ZIBs.",13

This Zn0.3V2O5·1.5H2O cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 426 mA·h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and exhibits an unprecedented superlong-term cyclic stability with a capacity retention of 96% over 20,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Its electrochemical mechanism is elucidated. The lattice contraction induced by zinc intercalation and the expansion caused by hydronium intercalation cancel each other and allow the lattice to remain constant during charge/discharge, favoring cyclic stability. The hierarchically porous structure provides abundant contact with electrolyte, shortens ion diffusion path, and provides cushion for relieving strain generated during electrochemical processes, facilitating both fast kinetics and long-term stability.",9
"With the growing demands for large-scale energy storage, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) with distinct advantages, including resource abundance, low-cost, high-safety, and acceptable energy density, are considered as potential substitutes for Li-ion batteries. Although numerous efforts are devoted to design and develop high performance cathodes and aqueous electrolytes for ZIBs, many challenges, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, water evaporation, and liquid leakage, have greatly hindered the development of aqueous ZIBs. Developing “beyond aqueous” electrolytes can be able to avoid these issues due to the absence of water, which are beneficial for the achieving of highly efficient ZIBs. In this review, the recent development of the “beyond aqueous” electrolytes, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all-solid-state, quasi-solid-state electrolytes, and deep eutectic electrolytes are presented. The critical issues and the corresponding strategies of the designing of “beyond aqueous” electrolytes for ZIBs are also summarized.",13
"The zinc-ion battery (ZIB) is a 2 century-old technology but has recently attracted renewed interest owing to the possibility of switching from primary to rechargeable ZIBs. Nowadays, ZIBs employing a mild aqueous electrolyte are considered one of the most promising candidates for emerging energy storage systems (ESS) and portable electronics applications due to their environmental friendliness, safety, low cost, and acceptable energy density. However, there are many drawbacks associated with these batteries that have not yet been resolved. In this Review, we present the challenges and recent developments related to rechargeable ZIB research. Recent research trends and directions on electrode materials that can store Zn2+ and electrolytes that can improve the battery performance are comprehensively discussed.",13
"Although promising, the practical use of zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) remains plagued with uncontrollable dendrite growth, parasitic side reactions, and the high intercalation energy of divalent Zn2+ ions. Hence, much work has been conducted to alleviate these issues to maximize the energy density and cyclic life of the cell. In this holistic review, the mechanisms and rationale for the stated challenges shall be summarized, followed by the corresponding strategies employed to mitigate them. Thereafter, a perspective on present research and the outlook of ZIBs would be put forth in hopes to enhance their electrochemical properties in a multipronged approach.",13
"The authors report on Li-7, F-19, and H-1 pulsed field gradient NMR measurements of 26 organosilyl nitrile solvent-based electrolytes of either lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) or lithium hexafluorophosphate. Lithium transport numbers (as high as 0.50) were measured and are highest in the LiTFSI electrolytes. The authors also report on solvent blend electrolytes of fluoroorganosilyl (FOS) nitrile solvent mixed with ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate. Solvent diffusion measurements on an electrolyte with 6% FOS suggest both the FOS and EC solvate the lithium cation. By comparing lithium transport and transference numbers, the authors find less ion pairing in FOS nitrile carbonate blend electrolytes and difluoroorganosilyl nitrile electrolytes.",3
"Understanding the aging mechanism of silicon-based negative electrodes for lithium-ion batteries upon cycling is essential to solve the problem of low coulombic efficiency and capacity fading and further to implement this new high-capacity material in commercial cells. Nevertheless, such studies have so far focused on half cells in which silicon is cycled versus an infinite reservoir of lithium. In the present work, the aging mechanism of silicon-based electrodes is studied upon cycling in a full Li-ion cell configuration with LiCoO2 as the positive electrode. Postmortem analyses of both electrodes clearly indicate that neither one of them contains lithium and that no discernible degradation results from the cycling. The aging mechanism can be explained by the reduction of solvent molecules. Electrons extracted from the positive electrode are responsible for an internal imbalance in the cell, which results in progressive slippage of the electrodes and reduces the compositional range of cyclable lithium ions for both electrodes.",0
"Although the small-molecule lithium salt solutions currently employed in lithium-ion batteries display high ionic conductivity, sigma, most of the initial current is carried by the electrochemically inactive anion, resulting in concentration polarization of the salt during cycling. Liquid electrolytes with high Li+ transference number, t(+)., and high sigma could improve battery performance by limiting these concentration gradients. We propose lithium-neutralized polyanions in solution as an intriguing strategy to attain both high t(+),. and high sigma at room temperature and validate the approach using a model system. Pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PFG-NMR) is used to attain self diffusion coefficients of the ions and hence t(+).. Conductivity calculated from PFG-NMR showed good agreement with conductivity measured using a conductivity meter. Although the polyelectrolyte solutions exhibit maxima in conductivity at around 0.5 M Li+ (1.5 mS/cm), t(+), continuously increases with concentration, achieving 0.98 at 1.0 M Li+ in solutions containing the highest molecular weight polyanion studied.",0
"Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI) is regarded as an alternative to the classical LiPF6 salt in today's LiFePO4/graphite-based Li-ion batteries electrolyte owing to its slightly higher conductivity and lower fluorine content. In an attempt to better evaluate the safety issues, here we report the comparative study of the LiFSI and LiPF6 based electrolyte/lithiated graphite interface thermal behavior. DSC measurements with LiFSI-based electrolyte reveal a sharp exotherm with large heat release though at higher onset and peak temperatures compared to LiPF6-based electrolyte. With the help of GC/MS, F-19 NMR and ESI-HRMS analyses, we assume that this highly energetic peak around 200 degrees C, which is dependant upon the lithium content, is mainly related to electrochemical reduction of FSI- anion. In a strategy to limit the probability and damage of thermal runaway event, electrolyte additives such as vinylene carbonate (VC), fluoro ethylene carbonate (FEC), di-isocyanato hexane (DIH) and toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) have been investigated and shown to significantly lower the energy associated with the exothermic phenomenon.

"In recent years, impressive advances in harvesting renewable energy have led to a pressing demand for the complimentary energy storage technology. Here, a high Coulombic efficiency (similar to 99.7%) Al battery is developed using earth-abundant aluminum as the anode, graphite as the cathode, and a cheap ionic liquid analog electrolyte made from a mixture of AlCl3 and urea in a 1.3:1 molar ratio. The battery displays discharge voltage plateaus around 1.9 and 1.5 V (average discharge = 1.73 V) and yielded a specific cathode capacity of similar to 73 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) (similar to 1.4 C). High Coulombic efficiency over a range of charge-discharge rates and stability over similar to 150-200 cycles was easily demonstrated. In situ Raman spectroscopy clearly showed chloroaluminate anion intercalation/deintercalation of graphite (positive electrode) during charge-discharge and suggested the formation of a stage 2 graphite intercalation compound when fully charged. Raman spectroscopy and NMR suggested the existence of AlCl4-, Al2Cl7- anions and [AlCl2 center dot(urea)(n)](+) cations in the AlCl3/urea electrolyte when an excess of AlCl3 was present. Aluminum deposition therefore proceeded through two pathways, one involving Al2Cl7 anions and the other involving [AlCl2 center dot(urea)(n)](+) cations. This battery is a promising prospect for a future high-performance, low-cost energy storage device.",0
"Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI) is an interesting electrolyte for lithium ion batteries and valeronitrile is a good solvent for LiFSI as it forms complexes with the Li+-ions. In the present work, this complexation was studied by optical spectroscopy (Raman and IR), as well as by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Based on these spectrocopic information a chemical model for the complexation was developed and the equilibrium constants for the formation of the different species that were considered are reported.

"New glyme-Li salt complexes were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of a novel cyclic imide lithium salt LiN(C2F4S2O4) (LiCTFSI) and a glyme (triglyme (G3) or tetraglyme (G4)). The glyme-Li salt complexes, [Li(G3)][CTFSI] and [Li(G(4))][CTFSI], are solid and liquid, respectively, at room temperature. The thermal stability of [Li(G4)][CTFSI] is much higher than that of pure G4, and the vapor pressure of [Li(G4)][CTFSI] is negligible at temperatures lower than 100 degrees C. Although the viscosity of [Li(G4)][CTFSI] is high (132.0 mPa s at 30 degrees C), because of its high molar concentration (ca. 3 mol dm(-3)), its ionic conductivity at 30 degrees C is relatively high, i.e., 0.8 mS cm(-1), which is slightly lower than that of a conventional organic electrolyte solution (1 mol dm(-3) LiTFSI dissolved in propylene carbonate). The self-diffusion coefficients of a Li+ cation, a CTFSI- anion, and a glyme molecule were measured by the pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR method (PGSE-NMR). The ionicity (dissociativity) of [Li(G4)][CTFSI] at 30 degrees C is ca. 0.5, as estimated from the PGSE-NMR diffusivity measurements and the ionic conductivity measurements. Results of linear sweep voltammetry revealed that [Li(G4)][CTFSI] is electrochemically stable in an electrode potential range of 0-4.5 V vs. Li/Li+. The reversible deposition-stripping behavior of lithium was observed by cyclic voltammetry. The [LiCoO2][Li(G4)][CTFSI][Li metal] cell showed a stable charge-discharge cycling behavior during 50 cycles, indicating that the [Li(G4)][CTFSI] complex is applicable to a 4V class lithium secondary battery.

"Additives such as vinylene carbonate (VC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) are commonly added to lithium-ion battery electrolytes in order to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode, suppressing continuous solvent reduction. In this work, we directly compare VC and FEC by analyzing the SEI with FTIR and XPS, and the evolved gases with on-line electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) in different model systems. Since both additives evolve mainly CO2 during formation, the effect of CO2 as an additive is compared to the addition of VC and FEC. While Li2CO3 is as expected the main SEI compound found due to the added CO2, surprisingly no CO was detected in the gas phase of such cells. Based on FTIR, NMR and OEMS analyses of cells filled with C-13 labeled CO2, we suggest amechanism explaining the beneficial effects of CO2 and hence also of CO2 evolving additives in lithium-ion battery cells. While the generation of polycarbonate from FEC or VC reduction is observed, the generation of Li2CO3 may be as important as the generation of polycarbonate. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

"The aqueous aluminum-air (Al-air) battery demonstrates promising applications in energy storage and conversion due to its high energy density and cost effectiveness. Nevertheless, it suffers from the grievous corrosion of the Al anode and parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a strategy that manipulates the H bond network of the electrolyte is applied to alleviate the parasitic reactions. It is verified that the introduced low-cost urea (CO(NH2)(2)) molecules with abundant N and O atoms can significantly strengthen the H-bond in the electrolyte and reduce the water activity, thereby effectively inhibiting the HER at the Al metal anode. The hydrogen evolution tests demonstrate that the HER rate decreases by 82% in the optimized electrolyte. Moreover, the performances of Al-air full cells are greatly improved, and the specific capacities based on Al anodes can reach 2330 mAh g(-1) at 35 mA cm(-2), far higher than that of a pristine electrolyte (4 M KOH, 1052 mAh g(-1)). Furthermore, in the on-off cycle discharge tests that simulate real applications, the operating life of the cell is extended by about 3 times. This approach of strengthening the H-bond network should shed some light on improving aqueous Al-air batteries as well as other aqueous batteries.",16
"Aqueous zinc batteries are the frontiers in electrochemical energy-storing devices due to their environmental friendlies, excellent safety, and low-cost nature. However, dendrite growth, gas generation and, limited cycling life are the bottlenecks for aqueous zinc batteries' practical use. Here, we engineered a water-in-bisalt electrolyte with a hydrogen-bond rich additive 1,2-dimethoxy ethane (DME), which synergistically reduces free water activity and improves the electrochemical performance of aqueous lithium - zinc hybrid batteries. As a result, the Zn parallel to Cu half-cell exhibits 99.43% average coulombic efficiency (ACE) at 0.5 mA cm(-2) after 200 cycles using DME additive. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, FTIR, Raman, and NMR confirm the significant decrease of water activity via the synergetic effect of water-in-bisalt electrolyte and the hydrogen-bond rich additive (DME). Interestingly, the synergetic effect improves zinc nucleation and growth on the surface of the anode and forms homogeneous, dense and smooth zinc deposition. In contrast, the ACE of the non-DME-containing electrolyte is 99.25%., at the same condition, The Zn parallel to LFP full cell with the DME additive gives a CE higher than 99.3% and the capacity retention of 99.49% after 100 cycles at 91 mAg(-1) compared to almost no capacity in the absence of DME after 35 cycles.",11
The aim of the present work is to generalize an ion transport phenomena observed in composite polymeric electrolytes using the previously developed models as well as design a new approach which would be helpful in describing changes in conductivity and lithium ion transference numbers occurring upon addition of fillers to polymeric electrolytes. The concept is based on the observation of changes in ionic associations in the polymeric electrolytes studied in a wide salt concentration range. The idea is illustrated by the results coming from a variety of electrochemical and structural data obtained for composite electrolytes containing specially designed inorganic and organic fillers.

"We investigated rechargeable aluminum (Al) batteries composed of an Al negative electrode, a graphite positive electrode, and an ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte at temperatures down to −40 °C. The reversible battery discharge capacity at low temperatures could be superior to that at room temperature. In situ/operando electrochemical and synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments combined with theoretical modeling revealed stable AlCl4−/graphite intercalation up to stage 3 at low temperatures, whereas intercalation was reversible up to stage 4 at room temperature (RT). The higher-degree anion/graphite intercalation at low temperatures affords rechargeable Al battery with higher discharge voltage (up to 2.5 V, a record for Al battery) and energy density. A remarkable cycle life of >20,000 cycles at a rate of 6C (10 minutes charge time) was achievable for Al battery operating at low temperatures, corresponding to a >50-year battery life if charged/discharged once daily.",4
"In order to shed some light into the importance of the anodic reaction in reversible aluminium batteries, we investigate here the electrodeposition of aluminium in an ionic liquid electrolyte (BMImCl-AlCl3) using different substrates. We explore the influence of the type of anodic material (aluminium, stainless steel and carbon) and its 3D geometry on the reversibility of the anodic reaction by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The shape of the CVs confirms that electrodeposition of aluminium was feasible in the three materials but the highest peak currents and smallest peak separation in the CV of the aluminium anode suggested that this material was the most promising. Interestingly, carbon-based substrates appeared as an interesting alternative due to the high peak currents in CV, moderate overpotentials and dual role as anode and cathode. 3D substrates such as fiber-based carbon paper and aluminium mesh showed significantly smaller overpotentials and higher efficiencies for Al reaction suggesting that the use of 3D substrates in full batteries might result in enhanced power. This is corroborated by polarization testing of full Al-batteries.",4
"The pairing of an aluminum anode with a cathode of high energy and power density determines the future of aluminum-ion battery technology. The question is—“Is there any suitable cathode material which is capable of storing sufficiently large amount of trivalent aluminum-ions at relatively higher operating potential?”. Graphene emerges to be a fitting answer. Graphene emerged in the research arena of aluminum-ion battery merely three years ago. However, research progress in this front has since been tremendous. Outperforming all other known cathode materials, several remarkable breakthroughs have been made with graphene, in offering extraordinary energy density, power density, cycle life, thermal stability, safety and flexibility. The future of the Al–graphene couple is indeed bright. This Minireview highlights the electrochemical performances, advantages and challenges of using graphene as the cathode in aluminum-ion batteries in conjugation with chloroaluminate based electrolytes. Additionally, the complex mechanism of charge storage in graphene is also elaborated.",5
"Confronted with challenges in promoting fast AlxCly− anion diffusion and intercalation for aluminum ion batteries (AIBs), it is of vital importance to rationally design gradient hetero-interfaces with an ideal built-in interfacial electric potential to enhance charge diffusion and transfer kinetics. Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy to realize accurate tuning gradient heteroatom N and P doping in MOF-derived porous carbon in C@N-C@N,P-C graded heterostructures. Importantly, gradient N and P doping could modify the electronic structure of MOF-derived carbon as certified by DFT calculations, and lead to charge redistribution to induce graded energy levels and a built-in electric field in the C@N-C@N,P-C graded heteroatomic interface, thus boosting interfacial charge transfer and accelerating reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the large surface area and high porosity of C@N-C@N,P-C graded heterostructures could efficiently absorb electrolyte and enhance anion transport kinetics. As expected, the designed gradiently N,P-doped C@N-C@N,P-C heterostructure with a built-in interfacial electric field could facilitate electron and AlCl4− anion transfer spontaneously between N,P-C, N-C and C gradient components, exhibiting a superior capacity of 98 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. This strategy reveals new insights about the gradient energy band for designing high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.",5
"The pressing need for low-cost and large-scale stationary storage of electricity has led to a new wave of research on novel batteries made entirely of components that have high natural abundances and are easy to manufacture. One example of such an anode–electrolyte–cathode architecture comprises metallic aluminum, AlCl3:[EMIm]Cl (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) ionic liquid and graphite. Various forms of synthetic and natural graphite cathodes have been tested in recent years in this context. Here, a new type of compelling cathode based on inexpensive pyrene polymers is demonstrated. During charging, the condensed aromatic rings of these polymers are oxidized, which is accompanied by the uptake of aluminum tetrachloride anions (AlCl4−) from the chloroaluminate ionic liquid. Discharge is the fast inverse process of reduction and the release of AlCl4−. The electrochemical properties of the polypyrenes can be fine-tuned by the appropriate chemical derivatization. This process is showcased here by poly(nitropyrene-co-pyrene), which has a storage capacity of 100 mAh g−1, higher than the neat polypyrene (70 mAh g−1) or crystalline pyrene (20 mAh g−1), at a high discharge voltage (≈1.7 V), energy efficiency (≈86%), and cyclic stability (at least 1000 cycles).",4
"Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) based on poly (vinylidene difluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) containing propylene carbonate (PC), isobutyronitrile (IBN) and trimethyl acetonitrile (TMAN) solvent blend electrolytes were developed to enhance high temperature electrochemical performance and to improve safety of LiNi3/5Mn1/5Co1/5O2 (NMC622)parallel to graphite lithium ion battery (LIB) cells. These liquid electrolytes (LE) consist of lithium bis(trifluoro-methane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as conducting lithium salt and PC/nitrile (1:1, v/v) solvent blends. Ethylene sulfite (ES) and vinylene carbonate (VC) were used as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) forming additives and contributing to an excellent cycling stability of electrolytes comprising nitrile solvents in NMC622 parallel to graphite cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PFG NMR) and relative permittivity determination reveal remarkable ion conducting properties of IBN and TMAN solvents. Since their electrolytes are incompatible with lithium metal electrodes, their electrochemical stability window (ESW) was determined using lithiated lithium titanate (Li7Ti5O12) (LTO) as counter and reference electrodes and the obtained values were confirmed by quantum mechanical compu-tation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) confirmed significantly improved safety of IBN and TMAN containing electrolytes. Therefore, PVdF-HFP-based GPEs containing PC/nitrile solvent blends are a promising alternative to SOTA electrolyte for battery cycling at elevated temperature (60 degrees C) in NMC622 parallel to graphite cells.",5
"Natural abundance O-17 NMR measurements were conducted on electrolyte solutions conisting of Li [CF3SO2NSO2CF3] (LiTFSI) dissolved in the solvents of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and their mixtures at various concentrations. It was observed that O-17 chemical shifts of solvent molecules change with the concentration of LiTFSI. The chemical shift displacements of carbonyl oxygen are evidently greater than those of ethereal oxygen, strongly indicating that Li+ ion is coordinated with carbonyl oxygen rather than ethereal oxygen. To understand the detailed molecular interaction, computational modeling of O-17 chemical shifts was carried out on proposed solvation structures. By comparing the predicted chemical shifts with the experimental values, it is found that a Li+ ion is coordinated with four double bond oxygen atoms from EC, PC, EMC and TFSI- anion. In the case of excessive amount of solvents of EC, PC and EMC the Li+ coordinated solvent molecules are undergoing quick exchange with bulk solvent molecules, resulting in average O-17 chemical shifts. Several kinds of solvation structures are identified, where the proportion of each structure in the liquid electrolytes investigated depends on the concentration of LiTFSI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"F-19 NMR experiments were carried out to observe the change of the characteristics of the PVdF binder which is an auxiliary material of the lithium ion battery. PVdF has various crystalline or amorphous phases by thermal treatment. A mixture of cathode and auxiliary materials including PVdF was coated on aluminum foil as an electron collector and then subjected to thermal treatment at various temperatures. The overlapped 19F NMR signals obtained from the various phases were separately convoluted into the respective phases, and it was found that there was a relative ratio change of these phases. In addition, the crystal and amorphous phase of PVdF was changed during the vacuum drying, which is the last step of the actual electrode manufacturing. It was observed that the relative amount of amorphous phase, which may affect the flexibility of the electrode or the wettability of the electrolyte, abruptly changes after a certain temperature.",0
"Preventing the decomposition reactions of electrolyte solutions is essential for extending the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries. However, the exact mechanism(s) for electrolyte decomposition at the positive electrode, and particularly the soluble decomposition products that form and initiate further reactions at the negative electrode, are still largely unknown. In this work, a combination of operando gas measurements and solution NMR was used to study decomposition reactions of the electrolyte solution at NMC (LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2) and LCO (LiCoO2) electrodes. A partially delithiated LFP (LixFePO4) counter electrode was used to selectively identify the products formed through processes at the positive electrodes. Based on the detected soluble and gaseous products, two distinct routes with different onset potentials are proposed for the decomposition of the electrolyte solution at NMC electrodes. At low potentials (<80% state-of-charge, SOC), ethylene carbonate (EC) is dehydrogenated to form vinylene carbonate (VC) at the NMC surface, whereas at high potentials (>80% SOC), O-1(2) released from the transition metal oxide chemically oxidises the electrolyte solvent (EC) to form CO2, CO and H2O. The formation of water via this mechanism was confirmed by reacting O-17-labelled O-1(2) with EC and characterising the reaction products via(1)H and O-17 NMR spectroscopy. The water that is produced initiates secondary reactions, leading to the formation of the various products identified by NMR spectroscopy. Noticeably fewer decomposition products were detected in NMC/graphite cells compared to NMC/LixFePO4 cells, which is ascribed to the consumption of water (from the reaction of O-1(2) and EC) at the graphite electrode, preventing secondary decomposition reactions. The insights on electrolyte decomposition mechanisms at the positive electrode, and the consumption of decomposition products at the negative electrode contribute to understanding the origin of capacity loss in NMC/graphite cells, and are hoped to support the development of strategies to mitigate the degradation of NMC-based cells.",0
"In theory, fluoride-ion batteries (FIBs) should possess a high energy density; however, only Cu/CuF2 has exhibited a capacity greater than 500 mA h g(-1). Graphite fluoride, (CF)(n), has a high theoretical capacity of 864 mA h g(-1). Reversible defluorination and fluorination reactions of (CF)(n) have been observed in lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. In these alkaline-ion batteries, nearby alkali-metal ions enable the breakage of strong C-F bonds, whereas in FIBs, the C-F bonds must be broken electrochemically. We prepared (CF)(n) as the positive electrode for a liquid-electrolyte FIB and analyzed it via combustion ion chromatography, F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and various X-ray analyses. The discharge and charge capacities of the first cycle were 731 and 262 mA h g(-1), respectively. The discharging process defluorinated (CF)(n) and converted it into graphite-like carbon (GLC), indicating that the C-F bonds were electrochemically broken. After a discharge of approximately 650 mA h g(-1), F-19 NMR measurements revealed the presence of (C2F)(n), and (C4F)(n) phases with hyperconjugated C-F bonds, suggesting that during defluorination, stable (C2F)(n) and (C4F)(n) phases were formed from (CF)(n). During charging, primarily, the edges of GLC and acetylene black (carbon additive) domains were fluorinated to form >CF2 groups.",16
"Dimethylacetamide (DMAc) is used as an electrolyte stabilizing additive for lithium ion battery. The effects of DMAc on the enhancements of electrolyte thermal stability and the solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on graphite anode and LiFePO4 cathode were investigated via a combination of electrochemical methods, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC/DEC (1/1/1,weight ratio) electrolyte with 1% DMAc incorporation can be stable at 85 degrees C for over 6 months without precipitation and color change. In addition, the addition of 1% dimethylacetamide (DMAc) can significantly improve the cyclic performance of a LiFePO4/graphite cell at elevated temperature. These improved performances are ascribed to the enhancement of the thermal stability of the electrolyte and the modification of SEI components on graphite anode and LiFePO4 cathode. The explicit working mechanism of DMAc stabilizing LiPF6-based electrolyte is also discussed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",9
"In this work, a novel electrolyte additive, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMTS), is applied to Li-O-2 batteries to increase their practical discharge capacity and also their rate capability. By adding OMTS into a tetraethylene glycol dimethoxyethane (TEGDME)-based electrolyte, the solubility of oxygen increases significantly, and the ionic conductivity and viscosity remain the same. Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show that the Li-7 peak shifts downfield when adding OMTS to the electrolyte, indicating the increment of the solvation of Li+ in the electrolyte. The electrochemical tests show that, with an optimal OMTS content (10 vol% OMTS), the cell displays a high discharge capacity of 6778 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 mA cm(-2). Its capacity retention is more than double that of the cell with no OMTS additive at a large current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Further NMR and Li2O2 yield measurements during discharge indicate that the OMTS additive does not alter the discharge product, or compromise the stability of the TEGDME electrolyte. The great increment in energy density and power density could be attributed to the high oxygen solubility and increment of solvated Li+, leading to the formation of more nodular products, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",0
"The ionic liquid (IL) N-methyl-N-butylmorpholinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (C(4)mmor FSI) is examined from physical and electrochemical perspectives. Pulsed field gradient NMR spectroscopy shows that ion diffusivities are low compared with similar, non-ethereal ILs. Ionicity values indicate that above room temperature, less than 50% of ions contribute to conductivity.Lithium cycling in symmetrical cells using a C(4)mmor FSI-based electrolyte is best demonstrated at elevated temperatures. Specific capacities of 130 mAh g(-1) are achieved in a Li-LiFePO4 battery at 85 degrees C. FT-IR spectroscopic investigations of lithium electrodes suggest the presence of alkoxide species in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), implying a ring-opening reaction of C(4)mmor with lithium metal. In contrast, the SET derived from N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium FSI lacks the alkoxide signature but shows signs of alkyl unsaturation, and the activation energy for Li+ transport through this SEI is slightly lower than that for the C(4)mmor-derived SEI Our detailed findings give insight into the capabilities and limitations of rechargeable lithium metal batteries utilizing a C(4)mmor FSI electrolyte.",16
"Zinc-ion batteries are considered as potential large-scale renewable energy storage devices due to low redox potential, low cost, large capacity, high electric conductivity, nontoxicity and easy processing of zinc metal. However, the development of cathode materials for zinc-ion batteries to date has been mainly limited to tunnel manganese oxides and Prussian blue analogues. Here we have firstly developed NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode material for Zn-ion batteries. To compensate the low conductivity, graphene-like carbon wrapped Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles are fabricated. With Na3V2(PO4)3/C as cathode, Zn metal as both counter and reference electrodes, and 0.5 mol L−1 Zn(CH3COO)2 solution as electrolyte, the aqueous Zn-ion battery delivers a reversible capacity of 97 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C and retains 74% capacity after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the battery can be charged and discharged at high rate up to 10 C. The cyclic voltammogram analysis shows that the Zn-ion storage in Na3V2(PO4)3 is a diffusion-controlled kinetic process. A mechanism of Zn ion occupancy variation during cycling is proposed. Our results provide an example for understanding and designing the intercalation process of divalent metal ions in NASICON structured cathode for new type rechargeable divalent metal ion batteries.",13
"Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) feature high safety, low cost, environmental-friendliness, and promising electrochemical performance, and are therefore regarded as a potential technology to be applied in large-scale energy storage devices. However, ZIBs still face some critical challenges and bottlenecks.

"The development of low-cost and high-safety zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) has been extensively discussed and reviewed in recent years, but the work on the comprehensive discussion and perspectives in developing zinc-ion electrolytes is still relatively lacking. Faced with critical challenges and bottlenecks practically, the viability of ZIBs critically depends on the development of suitable electrolytes and their practical considerations. In this review, a systematic summary with regard to the basic characteristics of zinc-ion electrolytes facing different issues from optimization strategies to the fundamental science of electrolyte/electrode interfaces (EEIs), particularly in the feasible modifications and advanced characterizations of EEIs, has been put forward. Due to the lack of consideration of the practical issues in major academic studies, we have particularly highlighted aspects that mainly focus on the choice of the electrolyte system, dosage of liquid and fluid electrolytes, status of gel and all-solid electrolytes, together with other concerns related to the electrolytes. The final section proposes significant perspectives to guide and promote the development of zinc-ion electrolytes.",13
"The development of safe, inexpensive, and long service life stationary energy storage infrastructure is critical to support the decarbonization of the power and automotive sectors. While lithium-ion batteries are considered the industry standard of excellence for applications requiring high energy density, they may not be the best choice for all applications, particularly stationary energy storage. This study presents rechargeable Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) as a promising technology primed for greater utilization in stationary applications. We consider the main benefits and challenges of ZIBs by comparing key characteristics such as cost, safety, environmental impact, and lifetime with pumped hydro, compressed air, lithium-ion, lead-acid, and redox-flow batteries. The low projected manufacturing costs, high safety, and excellent recyclability of ZIBs highlight the potential success of the technology. However, commercialization efforts are bottlenecked by active material dissolution, a lack of realistic performance demonstrations, and the need for manufacturing validation and cost analysis at the pilot scale. Considering recent advancements to lifetime and capacity of ZIBs, we propose a modified research approach including performance analysis of high-loading electrodes, in situ/operando characterization of reaction mechanisms, and standardized testing protocols and reporting to move beyond the benchtop battery and better facilitate ZIB commercialization.",13
"Zinc (Zn) batteries have attracted great attention since Zn anode is cost-effective and safe, and also exhibit high capacity and low potential. Much effort has been made to achieve superior battery performance, i.e., structural design of cathodes, optimizing electrolytes, and modification of Zn anode [1,2,3]. Zn batteries can apply aqueous electrolytes and non-aqueous electrolytes. However, both of them also suffer from some obstacles in the practical applications. For examples, aqueous Zn batteries face the challenges in the structural stability of cathodes, Zn dendrite growth, and hydrogen evolution at the Zn anode. There are some challenges in rare cathodes, low-voltage of cathodes for organic Zn batteries. Recently, two papers published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition from Wang’s group [1] and Energy Environmental Science from Li’s group [4] reported the new development of electrolytes for improving the performance of Zn batteries.",12
"Zinc deposition and dissolution is a significant process in zinc-based batteries. During this process, the formation of zinc dendrites is pervasive, which leads to the loss of efficiency and capacity of batteries. The continually growing dendrites will finally pierce the separator and cause the batteries to short circuit. Thus, employing effective methods to inhibit the formation and growth of zinc dendrites is vital for the practical application of zinc-based batteries. This Minireview first clarifies the formation and growth principles of zinc dendrites. Then, the research and development of methods to solve the problem of zinc dendrites are reviewed, including ways to suppress the further formation and growth of dendrites as far as possible, to minimize the adverse effects of dendrites, along with ways to produce dendrite-free deposition processes. The mechanisms, advantages, drawbacks, and perspectives of these methods are illustrated. Thus, this overview of these methods will aid understanding of the formation process of zinc dendrites and provide an extensive, comprehensive, and professional reference to resolve the problem of zinc dendrites completely.",12
"Recently, poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) has attracted intensive attention for energy storage applications. Organic radical batteries built with this polymer display high power performance. However, the solubility of PTMA in commercial electrolytes shortens the lifespan and the overall performance of the battery. To circumvent this issue, we propose to immobilize PTMA in a three-dimensional network. Indeed, an electrolyte swollen network (gel) enables a good ionic diffusion and brings good mechanical properties to the cathodic material. Here we report on the synthesis of PTMA gels by a combination of Cu(0)-mediated reversible-deactivation radical polymerization and copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). The structure of the accordingly obtained gels is characterized by NMR, SEC and FTIR and the mechanical properties of these materials are studied by rheology. Finally, their electrochemical performances are studied in the context of organic radical batteries.",0
"Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is the gold standard matrix for polymer electrolytes used in actual all-solid lithium batteries. However, PEO solid polymer electrolytes show some limitations; such as relatively low ionic conductivity and lithium transference number resulting in the actual polymer-lithium batteries operating at 70 degrees C. In the last years, polycarbonates (PC) have been presented as an alternative polymer matrix with superior ionic conductivity for solid batteries which may work at room temperature. In this article we systematically investigated the properties of new polymers which combine varying composition of both ethylene oxide and carbonate groups. A series of poly(ethylene oxide carbonates) (PEO-PCs) have been synthesized by polycondensation between different ethylene oxide diols and dimethyl carbonate. As a result, eight new PEO-PCs with number of ethylene oxide units ranging from 2 to 45 between carbonate groups were synthesized and characterized in terms of physico-chemical properties (T-m and T-g). These PEO2-45-PC were formulated as solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) by adding different amounts of bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt. The effect of the SPE composition (ethylene oxide/carbonate ratio, salt content) on the ionic conductivity and thermal properties (glass transition temperature and melting temperature) was investigated. The optimum SPEs showing the lowest glass transition temperature led to highest ionic conductivity value of 3.7.10(-5) S cm(-1) at room temperature. FTIR spectra revealed the coordination between the carbonate groups in the polymer chain and the lithium salt. Li-7-F-19 NMR analysis T-1 relaxation and diffusion coefficients measurements indicated local dynamics that correlates with the general conductivity behaviour. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Dimethoxydimethylsilane (DODSi) is used as an interface stabilizing additive through a selective HF scavenging reaction for layered Ni-rich oxide cathodes. Exsitu NMR analyses demonstrated that DODSi effectively removes HF from the electrolyte based on the matched chemical reactivity of Si with F- and O with H+. The cells employing DODSi exhibit higher specific capacity with retention than those cycled with a DODSi-free electrolyte even under insitu HF generating conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analyses indicate that DODSi effectively protects the Ni-rich oxide cathodes against HF corrosion, resulting in improved surface stability of Ni-rich cathodes.",0
This work presents a different approach to preparing polymer electrolytes having borate ester groups for lithium ion batteries. The polymers were synthesized by reaction between poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PEGME) and BH 3-THF complex. Molecular weight of PEGMEs was changed with different chain lengths. Then the polymer electrolytes comprising boron were prepared by doping of the matrices with CF3 SO3 Li at various molar ratios with respect to EO to Li and they are abbreviated as PEGMEXB-B-Y The identification of the PEGME-borate esters was carried out by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Thermal properties of these electrolytes were investigated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The ionic conductivity of these novel polymer electrolytes was studied by dielectric-impedance spectroscopy. Lithium ion conductivity of these electrolytes was changed by the length of PEGME as well as the doping ratios. They exhibit approximate conductivities of 10(-4) S.cm(-1) at 30 degrees C and 10-3 S.cm(-1) at 100 degrees C.,3
"In this study, the formation of dicarbonate degradation products of ethylene carbonate-based carbonate mixtures containing dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate or diethyl carbonate that were combined with lithium or potassium metal, is investigated. It is shown by NMR and GCMS that the dicarbonate products dimethyl dioxahexane dioate, ethyl methyl dioxahexane dioate and diethyl dioxahexane dioate are formed from the reactants to different extents and, in particular, the potassium surface initiates the fast formation of the corresponding dicarbonate products. Experiments with deuterated DMC suggest an intermolecular mechanism of the dicarbonate formation. In cell tests, namely potassium vs. graphite, it is shown that the electrolyte formulation with the lowest tendency to dicarbonate formation (EC/DEC) exhibited the best cell stability respectively lowest cell aging.Electrolyte degradation: Formation of dialkyl dioxahexane dioate products from ethylene carbonate based electrolytes on potassium surfaces.image",1
"The physical and electrolytic properties, and charge-discharge characteristics for secondary lithium batteries of partially fluorinated methyl propyl carbonate (MPC) derivatives were examined. Dielectric constants of the fluorinated MPC derivatives except 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl methyl carbonate (PFPMC) tend to increase with increasing the number of fluorine atom. Viscosity of PFPMC with the highest molar volume is lower than those of other fluorinated MPC derivatives. Donor numbers (DN) of the fluorinated MPC derivatives were estimated by Si-29 NMR chemical shifts of triphenylsilanol. DN of the fluorinated MPC derivatives except PFPMC tends to decrease with increasing the number of fluorine atom. 3-Fluoropropyl methyl carbonate (FPMC) shows the highest specific conductivity at the temperature above about 25 degrees C. Oxidative decomposition potentials of the fluorinated MPC derivatives tend to increase with increasing the number of fluorine atom. PC-FPMC electrolyte shows higher lithium electrode cycling efficiency. Every PC-based fluorinated MPC derivative electrolyte shows higher discharge capacities for Li vertical bar LiCoO2 cells.",16
"The anodic stability of a series of electrolytes consisting of propylene carbonate (PC) solvent and BF1- anion was shown to be partially influenced by cation species. A lithium cation lowered the anodic stability of electrolytes, particularly when the content of the cation was mol dm(-1) or higher. It was considered that lithium cation had the high ability to coordinate anion species that provided the lower anodic stability. When the interaction between cation and anion was small enough, the higher anodic stability of BF1- anion was observed.",0
"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are favorable power source devices at the last two decades, owing to high energy density, rechargeable, long life cycle, portable, safe, rechargeable, good performance and friendly environment. To support their development, in this research has been successfully prepared polymer electrolyte membrane, a main component of LIBs, based on 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIm]Ac) ionic liquid-plasticized methyl cellulose/lithium perchlorate (MC/LiClO4). [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid was easy synthesized by metathesis reaction between 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([EMIm]Br) ionic liquid and potassium acetate (CH3COOK) at ambient temperature, for 1 hour. [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid was functional groups analyzed with Fourier Transform Infra-red (FT-IR) and structural analyzed with H-1-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and C-13-NMR. [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid-plasticized MC/LiClO4 biopolymer electrolyte membrane was prepared by casting solution, with [EMIm] Ac ionic liquid content, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% (w/w). Effect of 15% (w/w) [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid incorporation to MC/LiClO4 showed the best condition and selected as the optimum condition with conductivity, tensile strength, elongation break, and thermal stability of 9.160x10(-3) S.cm(-1), 24.19 MPa, 36.43%, similar to 56 and similar to 370 degrees C, respectively. These results confirm that [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid can plasticize biopolymer electrolyte membranes of MC/LiClO4 to be appealing performances to fulfill the LIB's separator requirement.

"Electrochemical energy storage with lignin-based composite electrodes offers a cheap and renewable source for batteries. Lignin composites have mainly been used in supercapacitors and little has been investigated related to applying these composites in batteries. Here we show a biodegradable hybrid Zn-ion battery with a polymer/lignin composite electrode as a cathode, a Zn anode and bio-ionic liquid electrolytes. Interestingly, the polymer/lignin composite cathode led to a higher discharge capacity compared to the charge capacity over the entire 100 charge/discharge cycling process. It was observed that the lignin concentration in the composite polymer electrode was crucial in obtaining such a phenomenon. Using SEM, electrochemical analysis and NMR, we showed that lignin electrocatalytically oxidizes during battery charging, which produced the extra energy. This results in obtaining a higher discharge capacity compared to the charge capacity. It is anticipated that such an electrocatalytic technique can be extended to other battery systems to harness clean electrochemical energy from biomass.",9
"To understand how Li+ interacts with individual carbonate molecules in nonaqueous electrolytes, we conducted natural abundance O-17 NMR measurements on electrolyte solutions of 1 M LiPF6 in a series of binary solvent mixtures of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). It was observed that the largest changes in O-17 chemical shift occurred at the carbonyl oxygens of EC, firmly establishing that Li+ strongly prefers EC over DMC in typical nonaqueous electrolytes, while mainly coordinating with carbonyl rather than ethereal oxygens. Further quantitative analysis of the displacements in O-17 chemical shifts renders a detailed Li+-solvation structure in these electrolyte solutions, revealing that maximum six EC molecules can coexist in the Li+-solvation sheath, while DMC association with Li+ is more noncommittal but simultaneously prevalent. This discovery, while aligning well with previous fragmental knowledge about Li+-solvation, reveals for the first time a complete picture of Li+ solvation structure in nonaqueous electrolytes.",8
"The increasing demand for a safe rechargeable battery with a high energy density per cell is driving a search for a novel solid electrolyte with a high Li+ or Na+ conductivity that is chemically stable in a working Li-ion or Na-ion battery. Li6ZnNb4O14 (LZNO) has been reported to exhibit a sigma(Li) > 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 250 degrees C, but to disproportionate into multiple phases on cooling from 850 degrees C to room-temperature. An investigation of the room-temperature Li-ion conductivity in a porous pellet of a multiphase product of a nominal LZNO composition is shown to have bulk sigma(Li) approximate to 3.3 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at room-temperature that increases to 1.4 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) by 50 degrees C. Li-7 MAS NMR spectra were fitted to two Lorentzian lines, one of which showed a dramatic increase with increasing temperature. A test for water stability indicates that Li+ may move to the particle and grain surfaces to react with adsorbed water as occurs in the garnet Li+ conductors.",0
"A novel methodology is reported on the use of internally referenced diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (IR-DOSY) in divulging the solution structure of lithium-ion battery electrolytes. Toluene was utilized as the internal reference for H-1-DOSY analysis due to its exceptionally low donor number and reasonable solubility in various electrolytes. With the introduction of the internal reference, the solvent coordination ratio of different species in the electrolytes can be easily determined by H-1-DOSY or Li-7-DOSY. This new technique was applied to different carbonate electrolytes, and the results were consistent with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Compared to conventional vibrational spectroscopy, this IR-DOSY technique avoids the complicated deconvolution of the spectrum and allows determination of the solvent coordination ratio of different species in electrolyte systems with two or more organic solvents.",16
"It is of general interest to combine the faradaic processes based high energy density of a battery with the non-faradaic processes based high power density of a capacitor in one cell. Surface area and functional groups of electrode materials strongly affect these properties. For the anode material Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), we suggest a polaron based mechanism that influences Li ion uptake and mobility. Here we show electrolytes containing a lithium salt induce an observable change in the bulk NMR relaxation properties of LTO nano particles. The longitudinal Li-7 NMR relaxation time of bulk LTO can change by almost an order of magnitude and, therefore, reacts very sensitively to the cation and its concentration in the surrounding electrolyte. The reversible effect is largely independent of the used anions and of potential anion decomposition products. It is concluded that lithium salt containing electrolytes increase the mobility of surface polarons. These polarons and additional lithium cations from the electrolyte can now diffuse through the bulk, induce the observed enhanced relaxation rate and enable the non-faradaic process. This picture of a Li+ ion equilibrium between electrolyte and solid may help with improving the charging properties of electrode materials.The surface chemistries of electrode materials strongly influence their faradaic and non-faradaic properties. Here, the anode material Li4Ti5O12 is probed in the presence of different electrolytes, and surface polarons are suggested to enable a Li ion equilibrium between the bulk and the electrolyte, explaining the role of defects for intercalative pseudocapacity and fast charging properties in this material.",1
"We used NMR imaging (MRI) combined with data analysis based on inverse modeling of the mass transport problem to determine ionic diffusion coefficients and transference numbers in electrolyte solutions of interest for Li-ion batteries. Sensitivity analyses have shown that accurate estimates of these parameters (as a function of concentration) are critical to the reliability of the predictions provided by models of porous electrodes. The inverse modeling (IM) solution was generated with an extension of the Planck-Nernst model for the transport of ionic species in electrolyte solutions. Concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients and transference numbers were derived using concentration profiles obtained from in situ F-19 MRI measurements. Material properties were reconstructed under minimal assumptions using methods of variational optimization to minimize the least-squares deviation between experimental and simulated concentration values with uncertainty of the reconstructions quantified using a Monte Carlo analysis. The diffusion coefficients obtained by pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) fall within the 95% confidence bounds for the diffusion coefficient values obtained by the MRI+IM method. The MRI +IM method also yields the concentration dependence of the Li+ transference number in agreement with trends obtained by electrochemical methods for similar systems and with predictions of theoretical models for concentrated electrolyte solutions, in marked contrast to the salt concentration dependence of transport numbers determined from PFG-NMR data.",0
"In this work, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to study the effect of water absorption in polymer gel electrolytes formed by amyltopectin rich starch, plasticized with glycerol and containing lithium perchlorate. The position of the Li-7 spin-lattice relaxation rate maximum is shifted progressively towards lower temperatures with increasing hydration, reflecting an increase of the lithium mobility. The mechanism responsible for the spin-lattice relaxation of the Li-7 nuclei in the get electrolytes are the fluctuations of the quadrupolar interaction due to the lithium motions. The Li-7 relaxation results of the gel electrolyte hydrated with 2.2 water per complex unit suggest that the lithium ions are almost decoupled from the polymer chain and coordinate, hence preferring the water molecules.

"Sulfuric acid is a ubiquitous compound for industrial processes, and aqueous sulfate solutions also play a critical role as electrolytes for many prominent battery chemistries. While the thermodynamic literature on it is quite well-developed, comprehensive studies of the solvation structure, particularly molecular-scale dynamical and transport properties, are less available. This study applies a multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach to the elucidation of the solvation structure and dynamics over wide temperature (-10 to 50 degrees C) and concentration (0-18 M) ranges, combining the O-17 shift, line width, and T-1 relaxation measurements, S-33 shift and line width measurements, and H-1 pulsed-field gradient NMR measurements of proton self-diffusivity. In conjunction, these results indicate a crossover between two regimes of solvation structure and dynamics, occurring above the concentration associated with the deep eutectic point (similar to 4.5 M), with the high-concentration regime dominated by a strong water-sulfate correlation. This description was borne out in detail by the activation energy trends with increasing concentration derived from the relaxation of both the H2O/H3O+ and H2SO4/HSO4-/SO42-17O resonances and the H-1 self-diffusivity. However, the O-17 chemical shift difference between the H2O/H3O+ and H2SO4/HSO4-/SO42- resonances across the entire temperature range is nevertheless strikingly linear. A computational approach coupling molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory NMR shift calculations to reproduce this trend is presented, which will be the subject of further development. This combination of multinuclear, dynamical NMR, and computational methods, and the results furnished by this study, will provide a platform for future studies on battery electrolytes where aqueous sulfate chemistry plays a central role in the solution structure.",15
"The growth of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes is problematic because it causes irreversible capacity loss and safety hazards. Localised high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) can form a mechanically stable solid-electrolyte interphase and prevent uneven growth of lithium metal. However, the optimal physicochemical properties of LHCEs have not been clearly determined which limits the choice to fluorinated non-solvating cosolvents (FNSCs). Also, FNSCs in LHCEs raise environmental concerns, are costly, and may cause low cathodic stability owing to their low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level, leading to unsatisfactory cycle life. Here, we spectroscopically measured the Li+ solvation ability and miscibility of candidate non-fluorinated non-solvating cosolvents (NFNSCs) and identified the suitable physicochemical properties for non-solvating cosolvents. Using our design principle, we proposed NFNSCs that deliver a coulombic efficiency up to 99.0% over 1400 cycles. NMR spectra revealed that the designed NFNSCs were highly stable in electrolytes during extended cycles. In addition, solvation structure analysis by Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculation of Li+ binding energy suggested that the low ability of these NFNSCs to solvate Li+ originates from the aromatic ring that allows delocalisation of electron pairs on the oxygen atom.Localised high-concentration electrolyte is key to prevent uneven growth of lithium metal by forming a mechanically stable solid-electrolyte interphase. Here, the authors identify the suitable physicochemical properties for non-solvating co-solvents that improve the performance of lithium metal battery.",1
"Molecular clustering and associated dynamic processes of lithium polysulfide species were unraveled using classical molecular dynamics and ab initio metadynamics calculations. The spectroscopic signatures of polysulfide clusters were analyzed using a multimodal analysis including experimental and computational nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. Lithium polysulfide solutes (Li2S4, Li2S8, and Li2S8) and their mixtures in a 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME) solvent undergo aggregation driven by intramolecular lithium-sulfur (Li-S) interactions, leading to distributions of cluster sizes, which could critically influence the functioning of lithium-sulfur batteries. Representative polysulfide clusters with systematic increases in molecular size were extracted from the classical molecular dynamics trajectories for subsequent structural spectroscopic property calculations using density functional theory analysis. Structural analysis of these clusters reveals progressively decreasing solvent involvement in Li+ coordination varying from Li2S4 to Li2S8, with more pronounced variation and changes in DME compared with those in DOL. These observations are reflected in the analysis of the experimental and theoretical Li-7 and O-17 NMR chemical shifts and pulsed field gradient-NMR diffusion measurements. A comparison of experimental and theoretical S K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectra shows that relatively large lithium sulfide chain clusters are likely to occur in the DOL/DME-solvated lithium sulfide systems. Ab initio metadynamics simulations and NMR analysis indicate that Li+ solvated by only the solvent can occur through Li+ dissociation from sulfide chains. However, the occurrence of sulfide-free Li+ is a minor mechanism compared with the dynamic aggregation and shuttling processes of polysulfide solvates in DOL/DME-based electrolytes of Li-S batteries. Overall, atomistic insights gained about clustering and lithium exchange dynamics will be critical for the predictive understanding of the polysulfide shuttling and nucleation process that dictates the Li-S battery performance.",0

"Tetragonal Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) is the best solid Li electrolyte reported in the literature. In this study we present the first in-depth study on the structure and Li ion dynamics of this structure type. We prepared two different tetragonal LGPS samples, Li10GeP2S12 and the new compound Li7GePS8. The Li ion dynamics and the structure of these materials were characterized using a multitude of complementary techniques, including impedance spectroscopy, Li-7 PFG NMR, Li-7 NMR relaxometry, X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, and P-31 MAS NMR. The exceptionally high ionic conductivity of tetragonal LGPS of similar to 10(-2) S cm(-1) is traced back to nearly isotropic Li hopping processes in the bulk lattice of LGPS with E-A approximate to 0.22 eV.",13
"Herein we investigate the influence of the sodium salt anion on the performance of Na-O-2 batteries. To illustrate the solvent solute interactions in various solvents, we use Na-23-NMR to probe the environment of Na+ in the presence of different anions (ClO4-, PF6-, OTf-, or TFSi-). Strong solvation of either the Na+ or the anion leads to solvent-separated ions where the anion has no measurable impact on the Na+ chemical shift. Contrarily, in weakly solvating solvents the increasing interaction of the anion (ClO4- < PF6- < OTf- < TFSi-) can indeed stabilize the Na+ due to formation of contact ion pairs. However, by employing these electrolytes in Na-O-2 cells, we demonstrate that changing from weakly interacting anions (ClO4-) to TFSi does not result in elevated battery performance. Nevertheless, a strong dependence of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability on the choice of sodium salt was found. By correlation of the physical properties of the electrolyte with the chemical SEI composition, the crucial role of the anion in the SEI formation process is revealed. The remarkable differences and consequences for long-term stability are further established by cycling Na coin cells, where electrolytes using NaTFSi are absolutely detrimental for metallic sodium, employing NaOTF and NaClO4 leads to short-term stability, and only the combination of 1,2-dimethoxyethane with NaPF6 allows for high efficiency and performance.",0
"Although Na-O-2 batteries have a low overpotential and good capacity retention, degradation reactions of glyme-based electrolytes are the primary reason for inefficiency in cell performance. The discharge capacity is accounted for through analysis of the side-products. Although sodium superoxide is the primary product (90% theoretical), quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the side-products (using H-1 NMR, iodometric titration, and on-line mass spectrometry) shows the presence of sodium acetate (similar to 3.5 %), and three-fold less sodium formate, methoxy (oxo) acetic anhydride, and sodium carbon-ate. Our reaction mechanism proposes two paths for their formation. Because the side-products are not fully removed during oxidation, they accumulate on the cathode upon cycling. Resting the cell at open circuit potential during discharge results in consumption of the superoxide through the reaction with diglyme, which greatly increases the fraction of side products, as also confirmed by ex situ reaction studies. These findings have implications in the search for more stable electrolytes.",15
"Rechargeable lithium ion batteries are important energy storage devices; however, the specific energy of existing lithium ion batteries is still insufficient for many applications due to the limited specific charge capacity of the electrode materials. The recent development of sulfur/mesoporous carbon nanocomposite cathodes represents a particularly exciting advance, but in full battery cells, sulfur-based cathodes have to be paired with metallic lithium anodes as the lithium source, which can result in serious safety issues. Here we report a novel lithium metal-free battery consisting of a Li2S/mesoporous carbon composite cathode and a silicon nanowire anode. This new battery yields a theoretical specific energy of 1550 Wh kg−1, which is four times that of the theoretical specific energy of existing lithium-ion batteries based on LiCoO2 cathodes and graphite anodes (∼410 Wh kg−1). The nanostructured design of both electrodes assists in overcoming the issues associated with using sulfur compounds and silicon in lithium-ion batteries, including poor electrical conductivity, significant structural changes, and volume expansion. We have experimentally realized an initial discharge specific energy of 630 Wh kg−1 based on the mass of the active electrode materials.",0
"Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high working voltage, low cost, and environmental friendliness, yet their development is hindered by their limited energy density. Pairing silicon—a most promising anode due to its highest theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g−1)—with a graphite cathode is a feasible strategy to address the challenge. Nevertheless, the cycling stability of silicon is unsatisfactory due to the loss of electrical contact resulting from the high interface stress when using rigid current collectors. In this work, a flexible interface design to regulate the stress distribution is proposed, via the construction of a silicon anode on a soft nylon fabric modified with a conductive Cu–Ni transition layer, which endows the silicon electrode with remarkable flexibility and stability over 50 000 bends. Assembly of the flexible silicon anode with an expanded graphite cathode yields a silicon–graphite DIB (SGDIB), which possesses record-breaking rate performance (up to 150 C) and cycling stability over 2000 cycles at 10 C with a capacity retention of 97%. Moreover, the SGDIB shows a high capacity retention of ≈84% after 1500 bends and a low self-discharging voltage loss of 0.0015% per bend after 10 000 bends, suggesting high potential for high-performance flexible energy-storage applications.",16

This 2 V battery shows an average specific capacity of 300 mAh g−1(S), a long cycle life, an expected low cost and high safety. Due to these properties, this new battery is expected to be a very valid power source for efficient electric vehicles.",0
"In this work, we have synthesized ordered WO3 nanorods via a facile hydrothermal process. And the series WO3–x nanorods with oxygen vacancies are obtained via a subsequent thermal reduction process. The formation mechanisms of WO3−x nanorods with different oxygen vacancies are proposed. And the electrochemical results reveal that the WO3−x nanorods exhibit the improved specific capacity due to the oxygen vacancies caused by the thermal reduction. More importantly, the reaction mechanism of the WO3−x nanorods as cathodes for aluminum-ion batteries has been proved.",5
"Polyacetal electrolytes have been demonstrated as promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries; however, the relationship between polymer structure and ion motion is difficult to characterize. Here, we study structure-property trends in ion diffusion with respect to polymer composition for a systematic series of five polyacetals with varying ratios of ethylene oxide (EO) to methylene oxide (MO) units, denoted as P(xEO-yMO), and PEO. We first use Li-7 and F-19 pulsed-field-gradient NMR spectroscopy to measure cation and anion self-diffusion, respectively, in polymer/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt mixtures. At 90 degrees C, we observe modest changes in Li+ diffusivity across all polymer compositions, while anion (TFSI-) self-diffusion coefficients decrease significantly with increasing MO content. At a given reduced temperature (T - T-g), all polyacetal electrolytes exhibit faster Li+ self-diffusion than PEO. Intriguingly, P(EO-MO) and P(EO-2MO) also show slower TFSI-anion self-diffusion than PEO at a given reduced temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that shorter distances between acetal oxygen atoms (O-CH2-O) compared to ether oxygens (O-CH2-CH2-O) promote more diverse, often asymmetric, Li+ coordination environments. Raman spectra reveal that anion-rich ion clusters in P(EO-MO) and P(EO-2MO) lead to decreased anion diffusivity, which along with increased cation diffusivity, support the viability of polyacetals as high-performance polymer electrolytes.",16
"Li metal batteries pairing Li metal anode with high-nickel layer structured oxide cathode are a promising energy storage technology to achieve high energy density. To obtain long cycling life for Li metal batteries, the electrolyte plays a pivotal role in stabilizing both the Li metal anode and the high-nickel cathode upon electrochemical cycling. Herein, we report a carbonate electrolyte that enables a Li parallel to Li-Ni0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cell to achieve a high gravimetric energy density of 366 Wh/kg and unprecedented cycling stability with 80% capacity retention after 335 cycles. The F-19 quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and interface characterization demonstrate that FEC and LiDFOB can reduce the consumption rate of each other and the electrolyte, form a robust LiF-rich SEI on Li metal anode, and improve the microstructure integrity of the high-nickel cathode.",1
"Engineering the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a promising approach to improving Li metal battery performance. Recent work has shown that alkali metal additives can lead to smooth Li deposits, yet the underlying mechanisms are not understood. In this work, we demonstrate that alkali metal additives (here, K+) alter SEI composition, thickness, and solubility. Through post-mortem elemental analyses, we find that K+ ions do not deposit, but instead modify the reactivity of the electrode-electrolyte interface. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT), we show that K+ mitigates solvent decomposition at the Li metal surface. These findings suggest that alkali metal additives can be leveraged to suppress the formation of undesired SEI components (e.g., Li2CO3, soluble organic species), serving as an alternative approach for SEI modification compared to sacrificial additives. We believe that our work will spur further interest in the underexplored area of cation engineering.",2
"To increase the safety and stability of lithium-ion batteries, the development of electrolytes based on ionic liquids (ILs) has gained a lot of attention in recent years. However, with graphite electrodes, neat ILs afford weak cycling performance in the absence of organic additives (e.g., vinylene carbonate, VC). The potential formation of a [Li+]-O-VC interaction/coordination could have a major influence on the observed electrochemical behavior of Li-ion batteries. On a specific electrolyte, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [C(1)C(6)Im][NTf2] in association with Li[NTf2] (1 mol L-1) and VC, we performed NOESY, {H-1-Li-7} HOESY correlations, and pulsed field gradient spin-echo NMR measurements, combined with molecular dynamics simulations to determine whether such an interaction/coordination between VC and Li+ ions is noticeable. {Li-7-H-1} HOESY experiment shows the vicinity of VC with [Li+] cation, and strong correlations and association between [Li+] and VC are observed in intense first peaks in radial distribution functions and quantified by the coordination numbers in the first solvation shell between [Li+] and the carbonyl oxygen atom of VC.",0
"In order to improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries, in this work, we investigate the effect of newly synthesized polymeric borate ester (PBE) additives on the electrochemical performance of the high-capacity silicon-graphite (Si-C) anode in half-cells coupled with the LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC532) cathode in full cells with a direct comparison to the conventional fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive. We present a one-step route to prepare polymer additives having borate ester groups by reacting organic diols with boric acid in a simple condensation reaction. One polymer synthesized with diethylene glycol (PBE-DG) is studied extensively, and then its chemical structure is confirmed by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy. When used as an additive in carbonate electrolyte solutions, it shows excellent electrochemical stability and improved battery performance. It is shown that after 50 cycles, the discharge capacity retention of its half-cells is 75% while the FEC-based electrolyte additive is much lower (37%). We have further investigated fresh and cycled electrode surfaces by SEM and XPS techniques and attributed improvements in the cycling performance to changes in the electrode morphology. In addition, the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interfase (SEI) layer that is rich in inorganic species (LiF) and poor in organic compounds leads to enhanced protection of the Si-C electrodes from degradation. This work opens the door to a different class of battery additives with the potential to enhance the energy density of Li-ion batteries.",0
"The synthesis and characterisation of novel poly[VDF-g-oligo(EO)] graft copolymers (where VDF and EO stand for vinylidene fluoride and ethylene oxide, respectively) are presented. First, 2-trifluoromethyl oligo-(EO) acrylate, MAFTEG, was prepared by esterification of triethylene glycol monomethyl ether (TEG) with 2-trifluoromethacrylic acid (MAF) catalyzed by methanesulfonic acid, in 50% yield. Then, various radical copolymerisations of the MAFTEG with VDF from different feeds (VDF ranging from 85 to 95 mol%) led to random poly[VDF-co-MAFTEG] copolymers that bore oligo(OE) side-chains in satisfactory yields (60-70%). These original graft copolymers were characterised by H-1 and F-19 NMR spectroscopy. Their molar masses reached ca. 7000 g mol(-1) and their thermal properties were investigated while their glass transition temperatures ranged between -31 and -19 degrees C. Their thermogravimetric analyses in air showed decomposition temperatures from 235 to 325 degrees C with 10% weight loss (Td, 10%). Gel polymer electrolytes were achieved at room temperature by blending an ionic liquid electrolyte (RTIL), poly[VDF-g-oligo(EO)] graft copolymers, and silica nanoparticles, the ionic liquid being made of 1-propyl-1-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PyrFSI) by dissolving lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI). These novel copolymers are of potential interest as gel polymer electrolytes in lithium ion batteries, showing competitive ambient conductivities of 0.2 mS cm(-1) that increased up to 0.5 mS cm(-1) with the content of silica nanoparticles at 20 wt%. In addition, the electrolyte gel appeared to be electrochemically stable in a wide range of potentials varying from 1.5 V to 4.1 V vs. Li+/Li, compatible with 4 V class lithium ion batteries.",16
"Although rechargeable aluminium-ion batteries could be very promising, there are only a few materials described in the literature that can insert aluminium. NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)(3) (NVP) is here investigated as a new positive electrode, using aluminium chloride dissolved in O-2-free water as electrolyte solution. The reversible capacity is around 60-100 mAh g(-1), depending on the cycling conditions. The electrochemical, analytical, NMR, XPS and XRD results all together corroborate that sodium is deinserted during first charge and then aluminium is inserted during the discharge. Both bulk insertion and surface capacitance can contribute to the specific capacity. This is the first report about true insertion of a trivalent cation into a NASICON-type structure. In addition, this material is also electrochemically active vs. Al metal in non-aqueous cell, using ionic liquid as electrolyte solution, with a revesible capacity about 60-70 mAh g(-1) at ca. 1.25 V vs. Al. However, in the case of using ionic liquid, sodium (and not aluminium) is reversibly (de) inserted [23]. The results demonstrate that NVP is promising as electrode for rechargeable aluminium batteries, and that the electrolyte solution strongly influence on the electrochemical reaction.

"Polymer-ionic liquid composite electrolytes based on poly (vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) and room temperature ionic liquid: 2,3-dimethyl-1-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMOImPF(6)) have been synthesized and studied. The addition of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and propylene carbonate (PC), both with high dielectric constant and low viscosity, to polymer electrolytes has been found to result in an enhancement of conductivity by one order of magnitude. Composite polymer electrolytes containing ionic liquid have been found to be thermally stable upto 300A degrees C. Motional narrowing observed in the variation of line width of H-1 and F-19 NMR peaks with temperature suggests that both cations and anions are mobile in these electrolytes.",0
"Employing linear carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) as electrolyte solvents provides an opportunity to design appropriate electrolyte systems for high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, in practice, the use of linear carbonate-containing electrolytes is quite challenging because linear carbonates readily decompose at Na metal electrodes or sodiated anodes. One of the promising approaches is using an electrolyte additive to resolve the critical problems related to linear carbonates. Our investigation reveals that remarkable enhancement in electrochemical performance of Na4Fe3(PO4)(2)(P2O7) cathodes with linear carbonate-containing electrolytes is achieved by using a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive. Importantly, the initial Coulombic efficiency of the Na deposition/stripping on a stainless steel (SS) electrode is drastically improved from 16% to 90% by introducing the FEC additive into ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC)/DEC (5/3/2, v/v/v)/0.5 M NaClO4. The underlying mechanism of FEC at the electrode-electrolyte interface is clearly demonstrated by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In addition, the Na4Fe3(PO4)(2)(P2O7) cathode in EC/PC/DEC (5/3/2, v/v/v)/0.5 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) with FEC delivers a discharge capacity of 90.5 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of C/2 and exhibits excellent capacity retention of 97.5% with high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% after 300 cycles at 30 degrees C.

"Organic-inorganic hybrid electrolytes based on the reaction of triblock copolymer poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol) bis(2-aminopropyl ether) and 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl isocyanate doped with lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate and Al2O3 nanowires were synthesized by a sol-gel process. The structural and electrochemical properties of the materials thus obtained were systematically investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, Si-29 CPMAS (cross-polarization magic angle spinning) NMR, alternate current impedance, and linear sweep voltammetry measurements. FTIR spectra showed the occurrence of complexation and interaction among the components. The maximum ionic conductivity values of 9.8 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) and 6.8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) were obtained at 30 and 75 A degrees C, respectively, for the solid hybrid electrolyte with a [O]/[Li] ratio of 16 and 1 wt% of Al2O3 nanowires. A Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher-like temperature dependence of ionic conductivity was observed for the hybrid electrolytes doped with fillers. The electrochemical stability window of similar to 4.0 V makes the organic-inorganic hybrid electrolyte promising for lithium-ion battery application at low voltages.",0
"Electrolyte solutions have a vital function in lithium-ion batteries. In consideration of their toxic and harmful characteristics and widespread applications in the EVs, the treatment or recovery of the electrolyte is of concern and accurate analysis is needed for the resource and environment benefits. In this work, we present a highly-selective electrolyte recovery method-transcritical CO2 extraction-that combined the extraction and separation processes together. The use of response surface methodology helps in obtaining a simplified and optimized extraction protocol at room temperature and low pressure saving time and reagents. In order to evaluate these extracts, various techniques like GC-MS, GC-FID, FITR and NMR were applied. The GC-FID quantitative analysis and calculation formula may help with realizing the oriented control of the extraction process, and hexafluorophosphate (PF6-), fluoride (F-) and difluorophosphate (PO2F2-) detected by both F-19 and P-31 spectra imply the degradation pathway.",16
"In this work, we demonstrate an ultrasonic catalysis method for promoting the ORR rate and enhancing discharge performance of saltwater Al/Mg-air flow batteries, in which focused airborne ultrasound (FAU) is utilized. Experimental results show that compared with the batteries not sonicated, the percentage increase of peak power density of batteries catalyzed by FAU can reach 28.61% for the Al-air flow battery and 33.77% for the Mg-air flow one, respectively, when the ultrasonic frequency is 608.4 kHz. The measured optimal peak power densities are up to 18.9 mW cm−2 and 73.4 mW cm−2 for the Al/Mg-air flow batteries catalyzed by FAU, respectively, when the electric catalysts loaded with Pt/C are employed for the cathode. Our numerical simulation indicates that the sound pressure and acoustic streaming on the cathode surface may enhance the oxygen diffusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize the gas-borne ultrasonic catalysis effect to promote the ORR of metal-air flow batteries.",6
"In this study, lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) was used for the first time in a fluoride shuttle battery (FSB) to overcome the solubility problem of fluorine-based salts typically present in organic solvents. For this purpose, tetraglyme (G4) electrolytes containing CsF salt and LiBOB with three different concentrations (LiBOB0.06/CsF/G4, LiBOB0.25/CsF/G4, and LiBOB0.5/CsF/G4) were prepared. The effects of LiBOB on the electrochemical compatibility of the bismuth fluoride positive electrode were examined by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge tests, and alternating current impedance measurements. The related discharge and charge reactions were confirmed by X-ray diffractometry, whereas F-19 NMR and Raman spectroscopies were used to detect potential interactions in the various LiBOB/CsF/G4 systems. At the lowest and highest LiBOB concentrations (i.e., in LiBOB0.06/CsF/G4 and LiBOB0.5/CsF/G4, respectively), the electrolyte decomposition was dominant, whereas the intermediate concentration in LiBOB0.25/CsF/G4 was found to be the optimum condition and played a critical role in CsF solubility, allowing a successful fluoride shuttle-based redox reaction.",1
"Current Li-S battery technology has yet to reach the promise of high capacity and suffers rapid capacity fade due in large part to the dissolution and diffusion of polysulphide intermediates. The electrolyte plays a significant role here as well as in stabilizing the Li metal anode electrochemistry. In this work, a novel hybrid electrolyte system is investigated based on varying composition of N-methyl, N-propyl pyrrolidinium bisfluorosulfonimide (C(3)mpyrFSI) ionic liquid (IL) and 1,2-dimethoxy ether (DME) at the saturated concentration of LiFSI salt, demonstrating a most favorable performance for an 80:20 IL/DME composition (by weight). This electrolyte presented higher ionic conductivity and diffusivity while simultaneously improving the electrochemical behavior of Li metal plating and stripping. The ionic interactions among different species of the electrolyte have been studied by NMR spin lattice relaxation time (T-1) measurements, which indicated that Li-DME is likely to form chelation compounds, thereby breaking down the larger ionic aggregates and resulting in smaller solvation shell and higher ionic mobility. An ex situ polysulphide dissolution study indicated that the hybrid electrolyte is also efficient in eliminating polysulphide dissolution. Therefore, due to its ability to suppress polysulphide dissolution and enhance Li transport properties, while minimizing the volatile organic solvent component, the hybrid electrolyte system is an excellent candidate to further explore for future Li-S systems.",1
"Constructing the M-N-C (M = Fe, Co, etc.) with meso- and macroporous structures is an effective strategy for designing the high-performance catalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, these structures can hardly be achieved via the pyrolysis of classic metal-organic frameworks. Herein, we prepare the CoFe nanoparticles with surface oxides dispersed in Co/Fe-N-C support via carbonizing melamine and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelated with metal ions. This hybrid exhibits high proportions of meso- and macropores along with excellent ORR catalytic activity, as evidenced by the half-wave potentials of 0.91 and 0.61 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH and 3.5 wt% NaCl, respectively. The Al/Mg-air batteries with this catalyst exhibit superior performance to those employing Pt/C, primarily derived from the enlarged pore diameters and the exposed ORR active sites substantially enhancing the air-electrode performance. Our study provides an avenue to broaden the pore sizes of M-N-C for boosting its ORR catalytic activity.",6
"The depletion of lithium and cobalt resources is pushing researchers to develop a more sustainable energy economy in the battery field. The growth of the electric vehicles market is increasing the demand of high energy density storage devices beyond lithium-ion technology. In this work the synthesis and characterization of innovative ionic liquid-based electrolytes for aluminum and magnesium conduction is described. The presence of the two elements shows a synergistic effect, which raises the electrochemical performance to levels that have never been reached by a single metal electrolyte. The interplay between composition, structure and interactions of the ionic species composing the electrolyte is studied. The twin electrolytes are able to deposit and strip simultaneously Mg and Al with a low overvoltage (50 mV), a Coulombic efficiency of 99.66% and lasting for more than 700 cycles. Finally, a prototype battery is assembled and tested under operating conditions.",6
"New and novel systems for the reversible electrochemical storage of energy are required to sustain the increasing global energy demands. Indeed the high cost, the intrinsic energy limits and the strategic aspects of lithium and lithium technology-related metals (e.g., Co) are prompting the research towards the development of battery systems based on novel chemistries. In this regard, light multivalent metals are considered the holy grail. Magnesium and aluminum, for example, can be considered one of the best choices due to their low reduction potential (-1.66 and -2.37 V vs. SHE for Al3+/Al and Mg2+/Mg, respectively), high volumetric and gravimetric theoretical capacities (2980 Ahbold dotkg-1 and 8046 Ahbold dotdm-3 for Al, and 2205 Ahbold dotkg-1 and 3832 Ahbold dotdm-3 for Mg), high abundance in the Earth's crust and low cost (1'925 and 2'700 $bold dotton-1 for Al and Mg, respectively) [1, 2]. The main roadblock to the development of these technologies is the discovery of efficient, stable and high-performing electrolytes. Ionic liquids have been demonstrated to be a good choice to be used as solvents in multivalent metal electrolytes, thanks to the low volatility and high solvating powers [3, 4]. Despite large efforts, there are no examples in the literature that demonstrate the advantage of the synergic effect of the coupling of Mg2+/Al3+ in the deposition and stripping processes. Moreover, the fundamental understanding of ion coordination in this novel class of electrolytes would be a cornerstone information necessary to reveal the conduction mechanism. In this work we study the properties of a family of hybrid Al/Mg electrolytes with formula [Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)x (x = 0, 0.056, 0.091 and 0.146), to foster the synergic effect of these two metals for application in multivalent metal secondary batteries. In this study we combine thermal analyses, vibrational, electric and nuclear magnetic spectroscopies to achieve a clear picture of the ionic coordination occurring in the proposed electrolytes and how ions are able to rearrange and form ionic coordination nanodomains. It is demonstrated that AlCl4- and Al2Cl7- species are formed, which act as ligands for δ-MgCl2 units. Thus, the Mg2+/Al3+ conduction occurs through the exchange of anionic species between the different ionic clusters. These phenomena are significantly correlated to the host medium dynamics of the IL matrix. The rise of the temperature results in an increased degree of disorder in the nanodomains, which modifies the long-range charge migration process. Finally, the electrochemical activity in the synergic Al/Mg alloy deposition and stripping is demonstrated.",6
"The 4,5-dicyano-2-trifluoromethyl-imidazolide (TDI-) anion is a potential lithium salt anion for lithium-ion batteries. In this paper the transport properties of LiTDI solutions in EC/DMC (50/50wt%) are compared to competing salts such as LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide), LiFAP (lithium tris(pentafluoroethane)-trifluorophosphate) and the most commonly used LiPF6 (lithium hexafluorophosphate). LiTDI in EC/DMC exhibits the lowest viscosity among the investigated electrolytes, but also the lowest conductivity: 6.84 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C (1 mol L-1). The self-diffusion coefficients (D(Li-7) and D (F-19)) determined by observing Li-7 and F-19 nuclei with the pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR technique allowed access, through application of the Stokes-Einstein and Nernst-Einstein equations, to the lithium transference number (t(+)), the effective ionic radius and the ionic dissociation coefficient (alpha(D)) of LiTDI in EC/DMC. The ion-pair dissociation and t(+) were also determined using conductivity and viscosity measurements and by following the Bruce-Vincent method respectively and were in good agreement with those obtained by PGSE-NMR. LiTDI displays in EC/DMC a cationic transference number t(+)=0.58, which is higher than that of LiPF6 in the same solvent mixture, meaning that the mobility of the PF6- anion is higher than the larger TDI- anion. Still, results from both methods indicate that, LiTDI, as many other lithium salts is only partially dissociated in EC/DMC. Only 31% of the ion pairs are dissociated at 25 degrees C whereas for LiPF6, LiTFSI and LiFAP this number reaches at least 64% in 1 mol L-1 solutions. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",4
"Developing security and next-generation battery systems have attracted much attention for fulfilled the green development requirements. Among of multivalent-ion batteries candidates, magnesium (Mg) batteries may be the most feasible choice due to its high electrode potential, large theoretical volume capacity, superior safety and abundant source. Nevertheless, the researches of rechargeable Mg batteries still remain at a nascent stage because of a significant challenge of the development of a suitable electrolyte with low flammability and cost, high conductivity, and compatibility with Mg anode. Another major obstacle is lack of an appropriate cathode hosts with large electrochemical window required for Mg2+ insertion. Therefore, recent studies are critical in developing advanced Mg electrolytes with high voltage windows (>4.0 V) and being compatible with Mg-metal anodes to overcome the above-mentioned issues. In this work, we introduce a review on the challenges, development and adopted promising strategies for Mg rechargeable batteries electrolytes. This comprehensive review covers all three classifications Mg-ion batteries electrolytes such as liquid state electrolytes (inorganic electrolytes, boron based electrolytes, magnesium organo-haloaluminate based electrolytes, phenolate or alkoxide salts based electrolytes and non-nucleophilic electrolytes), solid state electrolytes (inorganic solid electrolytes and polymeric electrolytes) and molten salts system (ionic liquid and high temperature molten salts), which can enable researchers to grasp the prevailing challenges, and motivate them to design novel electrolyte candidates for commercial application.",6
"Lithium-ion batteries have liquid electrolytes, which are corrosive and volatile, that would cause leakage and explosion during the rechargeable process at high temperatures. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to change the liquid electrolyte into a solid one, namely a solid polymer electrolyte. This work has prepared the solidpolymer electrolyte membranes by casting various 1-ethyl-3-tetrafluoroborate, [EMIm]BF4/Li+ ionic liquid, and PEO. In this study, [EMIm]BF4/Li+, a Li+ ion-attached ionic liquid, has been synthesized using a simple metathesis reaction between 1-ethyl- 3-methylimidazolium-bromide, [EMIm]Br, and lithium tetrafluoroborate, LiBF4 salt. [EMIm]Br has been synthesized from 1-methylimidazole and bromoethane precursors using Microwave Assisted Organic Synthesis (MAOS) method. The functional groups and structures of [EMIm]Br and [EMIm]BF4/Li+ have been confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra analysis. The analysis of ionic conductivities, crystallinities, mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and thermal stabilities have been confirmed by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and tensile tester, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Thermogravimetry Analysis (TGA), respectively. The highest ionic conductivity is 1.83 x 10(-3) S.cm(-1) at room temperature for polymer electrolyte membrane with 16% weight of the [EMIm]BF4/Li+ ionic liquid and also exhibits good mechanical flexibility and thermal stability.",8
"The high self-corrosion rate of the aluminum anode in the alkaline electrolyte will greatly lower the anode utilization efficiency, and therefore shorten the life of the aluminum-air battery. We discover that the self-corrosion rate of Al-0.5Mg-0.08Sn alloy anode in 4 M NaOH electrolyte can be reduced by more than 90% by alloying trace (≤0.10 wt%) Ce or Sm. After alloying trace Ce or Sm, the discharge voltage of the Al-air battery is stabilized, and the anode utilization efficiency and energy density increase by ∼100%. The reduction of self-corrosion rate arises from the precipitated phase transformation from the Mg2Sn phase to the Ce5Sn3 phase or the Sm4Sn3 phase and the microstructure homogenization. This work provides a novel method to suppress the self-corrosion of primary Al-air batteries while maintaining the discharge voltage.",6
"Air-free electrolytic dealloying using non-aqueous electrolytes is a sustainable method for creating nanoporous Al (NP-Al) with highly reactive nanoscale-sized ligaments from Al-Mg parent alloys while simultaneously recovering the sacrificial Mg. However, this synthesis strategy is limited in versatility by the low number of available non-aqueous electrolytes that can conduct Mg ions and has so far only been proven to work with all-phenyl complex (APC) electrolyte derived from in situ reaction between two equivalents of Lewis base C₆H₅ClMg and one equivalent of Lewis acid AlCl3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. Here we demonstrated that a new electrolyte consisting of MgCl2/AlCl3/Mg(TFSI)2 (or MACT) in glyme-based solvents recently introduced in the Mg-ion battery community can also be used to create NP-Al. This alternative electrolyte exhibits higher electrochemical performance than APC and can create ultrafine NP-Al with ≈ 6–14 nm ligament size, which is smaller than the ≈ 10–20 nm ligament size commonly achieved using APC.",6
"Compatibility of self-extinguishing property and electrochemical stability of electrolyte solutions containing organophosphorus compounds as flame retardants has been required for practical application of electrolyte solutions to lithium-ion batteries. By adding a Lewis acid, Ca2+, Mg2+, or Na+, to ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolyte solutions containing 50 vol.% trimethylphosphate or dimethyl methylphosphonate, the electrolyte solutions are able to suppress the co-intercalation of the organophosphorus compounds with Li+ into graphite. However, the coulombic efficiency in the first charge-discharge in a graphite/Li metal half-cell with an electrolyte solution depends on the species of the added Lewis acid and organophosphorus compound. The difference between the chemical-shift changes of the oxygen of the C=O bond in EC and the oxygen of the P=O bond in organophosphorus compounds in the oxygen-17 nuclear magnetic resonance (O-17 NMR) spectra of the electrolyte solutions was investigated. The investigation revealed that the difference in the acidities of the Lewis acids, electron-donating abilities of the organophosphorus compounds, and solvated structures with a Lewis acid affect the electrochemical stability of self-extinguishing electrolyte solutions.

"3, 3'-sulfonyldipropionitrile (SDPN) is structurally different from previously reported compounds and was studied as a film-forming additive for the LiMn2O4 cathode at elevated temperature. The retention capacity of the LiMn2O4/Li cell with the electrolyte (1.0M LiPF6-EC/DMC/EMC) containing 0.5 wt% SDPN cycled at 55 degrees C and increased significantly from 56.7% to 70.3% after 200 cycles. The SDPN is more easily oxidized than the solvents, and may take part in the formation of the interface layeon the cathode surface. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) show that the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is gradually formed during cycling. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data demonstrate that a thinner SEI with less inorganic degradation products can be formed on the surface of the LiMn2O4 cathode due to SDPN.

"Current commercial batteries are mainly metal based, with metal elements in charge carriers and/or electrode materials, which poses potential economic and environmental concerns due to the heavy use of nonrenewable metals. Thus, metal-free batteries present a unique opportunity as sustainable energy storage devices, though the relevant research is still in its infancy. Herein, we present an all-organic metal-free NH4+ ion full battery that can operate at a low temperature of 0 degrees C, by using polypyrrole (PPy) as the cathode, polyaniline (PANI) as the anode, and 19 m ammonium acetate aqueous solution as electrolyte. For the first time, PPy is demonstrated as a high-capacity host material for both NH4+ and K+ storage, when cycled in water in salt electrolytes (WiSEs). When tested in a three-electrode cell containing 25 m NH4CH3COO electrolyte, PPy exhibits an impressive capacity of 125 mA h g(-1) at a specific current of 1 A g(-1) and retains 43.61 mA h g(-1) at 25 A g(-1). Additionally, a full battery is assembled using the PPy cathode and PANI anode coupled with 19 m NH4CH3COO WiSE. This battery is found to deliver a capacity of 78.405 mA h g(-1) at 25 degrees C and 49.083 mA h g(-1) at 0 degrees C with a capacity retention of 71.83% after 200 cycles, demonstrating its potential for operations at low temperatures. Additionally, the physiochemical properties of NH4+-based WiSEs are examined by Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, to explore their electrochemical behaviors and the fundamental effect of salt concentration on the electrolyte characteristics. This study presents the first non-metal battery with potential for low-temperature applications and opens the door to future metal-free electronics that would generate long-term benefits to the environment.",2
"The cathodic deposition of poly(styrene sulfonate) on nanoarchitectured TiO2 electrodes is explored by cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments, showing a diffusion-controlled deposition described by Cottrell's law. The structure and composition of the polymer is evidenced by various spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and its morphology is studied by scanning electron microscopy. The average chain length can be estimated from the NMR spectra. The electropolymerization mechanism initiates by radical anion formation. The cycling behavior in half-cell batteries against Li metal is excellent, especially at high rates explored up to 10 C. The areal insertion capacity is above recent literature results, up to 80 mu A h cm(-2). The combination of normalized areal power density and areal energy density is one of the best reported in the literature.",0
"Enhancing the electrochemical stability and reversibility of redox-active organic molecules is crucial to improve the performance of non-aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). Compared with the widely adopted strategy of molecular engineering, we show in this study that tuning the intermolecular interaction between the active material with the supporting electrolyte is another feasible way to address the performance of non-aqueous organic RFBs. Combined with theoretical and experimental investigations, the influence of Lewis acidity of the supporting electrolyte cations and anions on the electrochemical stability and reversibility of bipyridine-based anode material is revealed. As a demonstration, a redox flow cell based on 4,4 '-bipyridine anolyte and ferrocene catholyte shows greatly enhanced performance by using supporting electrolyte composed of soft Lewis acid and soft Lewis base. This study provides an alternative, yet highly effective way to addressing the cyclability of an organic compound for non-aqueous RFBs.",8
"Co-intercalation of Hexafluorophosphate(PF6-) and Bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (TFSI-) anions as a result of the use of a mixed salt of LiPF6 and LiTFSI is studied for the increased performance of a dual-carbon battery (DCB). Unlike the fluorineor the imide-based anions (e.g., PF6- and TFSI-), the cluster formation between co intercalated PF6- and TFSI- in the positive electrode of a DCB results in achieving high discharge capacities with significantly increased cycle properties. A reversible discharge capacity of 85 mAh/g-cathode over 350 cycles with no significant degradation is presented. The Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% is reached after the initial 10 cycles and suitable rate property is also observed. F NMR analysis on graphitic carbon intercalated with PF6- and TFSI- suggests the interaction between two anions and ratio of intercalated PF6 and TFSIwas changed by applied voltage, resulting in the increased stability of the intercalated structure which is also supported by the first principles calculations.",4
"Polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) have stirred up great interest for their potential applications as electrolyte hosts in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) because of their desirable performance. In this work, PIL-based gel polymer electrolytes applied in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) at low-medium temperatures (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C) are first reported. A novel imidazolium-tetraalkylammonium-based dicationic polymeric ionic liquid, poly(N, N, N-trimethyl-N-(1-vinlyimidazolium-3-ethyl)-ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide) is successfully synthesized, and its structure and purity are confirmed by H-1 NMR, FTIR and elemental analysis. Subsequently, the ternary gel polymer electrolytes are prepared by blending the as-synthesized dicationic PIL as the polymer host with 1,2-dimethyl-3-ethoxyethyl imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (IM(2o2)11TFSI) ionic liquid and LiTFSI salt in different weight ratios. The PIL-LiTFSI-IM(2o2) 11TFSI electrolytes reveal low glass transition temperatures around -54 degrees C and high thermal stability to about 330 degrees C. Moreover, the ternary gel polymer electrolytes show good ion conductivity around 10(-4) S cm(-1) at low-medium temperatures, high electrochemical stability and good interfacial stability with lithium metal. Particularly, the Li/LiFePO4 cells assembled with polymer electrolytes at a rate of 0.1 C are able to deliver discharge capacities of about 160 mA h g(-1), 140 mA h g(-1) and 120 mA h g(-1) at 40 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively, with excellent capacity retention, as well as exhibiting acceptable rate capability. These findings reveal that dicationic PIL-based electrolytes have great potential for use as safe electrolytes in LMBs.",0
"The reversible electrochemical process (insertion/extraction) of lithium ions in graphitic carbon was monitored it? situ for the first time by Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using a novel NMR apparatus. The compression coin cell battery imager is a simple device that combines the functions of an electrochemical cell and an NMR detector. A series of 7Li NMR spectra obtained for a blend of spherical and flaky disordered graphitic carbon particles revealed two distinct chemical shift signatures for the lithium ions that were inserted and extracted in the first electrochemical cycle. The lithium signal at similar to 50 ppm is consistent with the interplane sites for lithium ions on the sixfold axis between two stacked aromatic carbon rings aligned in registry. The second predominant lithium signal at similar to 12 ppm occurs in the chemical shift region reported for high-stage lithiated graphite and a dispersion of lithium-ion sites found in disordered carbon matrices. In addition, we observed chemical shift signatures similar to those assigned to Li-7 nuclei in lithium oxide, lithium carbonate, lithium alkyls, and lithium alkoxides that occur near 0 ppm and represent lithium nuclei that are irreversibly bound in the electrode/electrolyte interphase. An increase in intensity in the spectral region that is normally associated with irreversibly bound lithium was observed during the first discharge cycle, as anticipated. However, the same peaks in the spectrum unexpectedly diminished during the subsequent charge cycle, suggesting that the interphase between the carbon electrode and the electrolyte is built up over several cycles.",3
"The Li3VO4@C microsphere composite was first reported as a novel cathode material for rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), which manifests the initial discharge capacity of 137 mAh g(-1) and and remains at 48 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The detailed intercalation mechanism of Al into the orthorhombic Li3VO4 is investigated by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Li3VO4@C electrodes and the nuclear magnetic resonance aluminum spectroscopy (Al-27 NMR) of ionic liquid electrolytes in different discharge/charge states. First-principle calculations are also carried out to investigate the structural change as Al inserts into the framework of Li3VO4. It is revealed that the Al/Li3VO4@C battery goes through electrochemical dissolution and deposition of metallic aluminum in the anode, as well as the insertion and deinsertion of Al3+ cations in the cathode in the meantime. The rechargeable AIBs fabricated in this work are of low cost and high safety, which may make a step forward in the development of novel cathode materials based on the acidic ionic liquid electrolyte system.",0
"Lithium-ion batteries pose certain drawbacks and alternatives are highly demanded. Requirements such as low corrosiveness, electrochemical stability and suitable electrolytes can be met by magnesium-ion batteries. Metalation of carbazole with Mg in THF in the presence of ethyl bromide yields the sparingly soluble Hauser base [(thf)(3)Mg(Carb)Br] (1) which shows a Schlenk-type equilibrium with formation of [(thf)(3)Mg(Carb)(2)] and [(thf)(4)MgBr2]. A THF solution of 1 shows a low over-potential and a good cyclability of electrodeposition/-stripping of Mg on a Cu current collector. An improved performance is achieved with the turbo-Hauser bases [(thf)(Carb)Mg(mu-Br/X)(2)Li(thf)(2)] (X=Br (2) and Cl (3)) which show a significantly higher solubility in ethereal solvents. The THF solvation energies increase from (thf)(x)MgBr2 over (thf)(x)Mg(Carb)Br to (thf)(x)Mg(Carb)(2) for an equal number x of ligated THF molecules.",16
The effect of the addition of propylene carbonate (PC) on the ion transport behaviour of nanocomposite polymer electrolytes having composition of polyethylene oxide-hexafluorophosphoric acid-fumed silica has been studied. The ionic conductivity of 6.89x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 298 K has been obtained for these electrolytes along with good mechanical and thermal properties. The variation of H-1 NMR linewidth with temperature shows line narrowing at the glass transition and melting temperature of the electrolytes which suggests the onset of long-range ion translational motion. The increase in ionic conductivity with the addition of PC is related to the transformation of these electrolytes to the amorphous phase which has been supported by X-ray diffraction results. The polymer electrolytes are thermally stable up to around 498 K and hence are suitable for various applications.,0
"New silane and siloxane compounds containing cyclic carbonate functional groups were synthesized and characterized. The compounds were prepared via two routes: hydrosilation of SiH containing siloxanes and alcoholysis of chlorosilanes with hydroxy-terminated oligoethers. The products were purified by distillation and solvent extraction and characterized using H-1, C-13, and Si-29 NMR. Upon doping with lithium bis(oxolato)borate (LiBOB), the conductivities of the compounds were determined. These carbonate compounds themselves did not show promising conductivities. However, when used as additives to silicone-containing oligoether electrolytes, the conductivities of the resulting mixtures were increased by up to 35%.",0
"The development of high-performance membrane materials for non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs) could unlock a milestone towards widespread commercialization of the technology. Understanding of transport phenomena through membrane materials requires diagnostic tools able to monitor the concentrations of redox active species. While membrane characterization in aqueous media focused the attention of the scientific community, dedicated efforts for non-aqueous electrolytes remain poorly developed. Here, we develop new methodologies to assess critical membrane properties, namely ion exchange capacity and species transport, applied to NAqRFBs. In the first part, we introduce a method based on F-19-NMR to quantify ion exchange capacity of membranes with hydrophobic anions commonly used in non-aqueous systems (e.g., PF6 (-) and BF4 (-)). We find a partial utilization of the ion exchange capacity compared to the values reported using traditional aqueous chemistry ions, possibly limiting the performance of NAqRFB systems. In the second part, we study mass transport with a microelectrode placed on the electrolyte tank. We determine TEMPO crossover rates through membranes by using simple calibration curves that relate steady-state currents at the microelectrode with redox active species concentration. Finally, we show the limitations of this approach in concentrated electrolyte systems, which are more representative of industrial flow battery operation.",16
"Two-electron transfer chemistry based on earth-abundant Mg and S offers great possibilities of delivering higher energy density than current Li-ion technology. The development of non-nucleophilic electrolytes that reversibly and efficiently plate and strip Mg is believed to be a major obstacle to the implementation of this divalent battery technology. In this study, we present a new type of organic magnesium borate-based electrolyte that primarily comprises tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyl)borate anions [B(HFP)(4)](-) and solvated cations [Mg4Cl6(DME)(6)](2+), which was synthesized via a facile in situ reaction of tris(hexafluoroisopropyl)borate [B(HFP)(3)], MgCl2 and Mg powder in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). Rigorous analyses including NMR, mass spectroscopy and single-crystal XRD were conducted to identify the equilibrium species in the abovementioned solution. The as-prepared Mg-ion electrolyte exhibited unprecedented Mg plating/stripping performance, such as high anodic stability up to 3.3 V (vs. Mg/Mg2+), high ionic conductivity of 5.58 mS cm(-1), a low overpotential of 0.11 V for plating processes and Coulombic efficiencies greater than 98%. By virtue of the non-nucleophilic nature of this electrolyte, a fully reversible Mg/S battery was constructed that displayed an extremely low overpotential of 0.3 V and a high discharge capacity of up to 1247 mA h g(-1) and yielded a specific energy of approximately 1200 W h kg(-1) (10 times higher that of the Chevrel benchmark) based on the weight of active sulfur. More significantly, commonly used sulfur-carbon nanotube (S-CNTs) cathodes with S contents of 80 wt% and S loadings of 1.5 mg cm(-2) were demonstrated to withstand more than 100 cycles without obvious capacity decay and to enable fast conversion processes, which achieved a charging current rate of up to 500 mA g(-1). Our findings convincingly validate the pivotal role of the newly designed non-nucleophilic Mg-ion electrolyte for practical Mg/S battery chemistry.",0
"An A/B/C triblock copolymer has been synthesized having potential applications as a self-contained nanoscale battery. A new organometallic compound was synthesized which serves as the anode. The polyelectrolyte block of the copolymer is an unsaturated polyether. The last block acts as the template to form metal oxide clusters and functions as the cathode. The triblock copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening metathesis polymerization using Grubbs's catalyst. GPC and NMR were used to monitor the polymerization. H-1 and C-13 NMR, FTIR, UV-vis, GPC with light scattering, and XPS were used to characterize the synthesized polymer.",9
"Connecting continuum-scale ion transport properties such as conductivity and cation transference number to microscopic transport properties such as ion dissociation and ion self-diffusivities is an unresolved challenge in characterizing polymer electrolytes. Better understanding of the relationship between microscopic and continuum scale transport properties would enable the rational design of improved electrolytes for applications such as lithium batteries. We present measurements of continuum and microscopic ion transport properties of nonflammable liquid electrolytes consisting of binary mixtures of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) with different end groups: diol, dimethyl carbonate, ethoxy-diol, and ethoxy-dimethyl carbonate. The continuum properties, conductivity and cation transference number, were measured by ac impedance spectroscopy and potentiostatic polarization, respectively. The ion self-diffusivities were measured by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PFG-NMR), and a microscopic cation transference number was calculated from these measurements. The measured ion self-diffusivities did not reflect the measured conductivities; in some cases, samples with high diffusivities exhibited low conductivity. We introduce a nondimensional parameter, beta, that combines microscopic diffusivities and conductivity. We show that beta is a sensitive function of end-group chemistry. In the ethoxylated electrolytes, beta is close to unity, the value expected for electrolytes that obey the Nernst-Einstein equation. In these cases, the microscopic and continuum transference numbers are in reasonable agreement. PFPE electrolytes devoid of ethoxy groups exhibit values of beta that are significantly lower than unity. In these cases, there is significant deviation between microscopic and continuum transference numbers. We propose that this may be due to electrostatic coupling of the cation and anion or contributions to the NMR signal from neutral ion pairs.",16
"Due to the increasing energy density demands of battery technology, it is vital to develop electrolytes with high electron storage capacity. Polyoxometalate (POM) clusters can act as electron sponges, storing and releasing multiple electrons and have potential as electron storage electrolytes for flow batteries. Despite this rational design of clusters for high storage ability can not yet be achieved as little is known about the features influencing storage ability. Here we report that the large POM clusters, {P5W30} and {P8W48}, can store up to 23 e(-) and 28 e(-) per cluster in acidic aqueous solution, respectively. Our investigations reveal key structural and speciation factors influencing the improved behaviour of these POMs over those previously reported (P2W18). We show, using NMR and MS, that for these polyoxotungstates hydrolysis equilibria for the different tungstate salts is key to explaining unexpected storage trends while the performance limit for {P5W30} and {P8W48}, can be attributed to unavoidable hydrogen generation, evidenced by GC. NMR spectroscopy, in combination with the MS analysis, provided experimental evidence for a cation/proton exchange process during the reduction/reoxidation process of {P5W30} which likely occurs due to this hydrogen generation. Our study offers a deeper understanding of the factors affecting the electron storage ability of POMs and provides insights allowing for further development of these materials for energy storage.",1
"The reaction kinetics, reversibility and long-term stability of Zn anodes are crucial for rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Polymer electrolyte additives are low cost and effective to modify the deposition behavior of Zn anodes. Here, an interesting phenomenon appears that cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes are improved by PEO additive in dilute aqueous electrolytes with different Zn salts, while the overpotential and longterm stability of Zn anodes vary significantly with different anions. Systematic electrochemical analysis coupled with NMR and MD simulation was performed to reveal the crucial role of salt anion in tuning the specific solvation structures and hydrogen bonding network of aqueous electrolytes with PEO additive, and interfacial double layer capacitance structures. The reaction kinetics and stability of Zn anodes were, therefore, intensively tuned by salt anions in aqueous electrolytes with PEO additives. The cycle life of Zn anode can be improved by 7?10 times with significantly reduced overpotential in bulky anion such as TFSI- based aqueous electrolyte than compact anion such as SO4 2- in PEO containing aqueous electrolytes. This work provides useful and low-cost concepts to effectively improve Zn anodes reaction dynamics and cycle life by choosing optimal electrolyte salts and additives.",0
"Lithium poly(4-styrenesulfonyl(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PSTFSI) polyelectrolytes made up of -SO2-N--SO2-CF3 anionic groups associated with a lithium cation and attached to a polystyrene chain have been prepared. In these polymers the transference number of the lithium cation is expected to be unity while the ionic conductivity is kept high. Two different single-ion polymers with a similar final structure were synthesized by two ways, monomer free radical polymerization and polymer modification (PSTFSI (a) and PSTFSI (b), respectively). These polyelectrolytes were mixed with poly(ethylene oxide) PEO into a composite membrane to form solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. These polymer alloys were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis and impedance spectroscopy to measure the ionic transport properties. Interestingly, ionic conductivity is about ten times higher for a membrane with PSTFSI (a) (approximate to 10(-5) S cm(-1)) compared to a membrane with lithium poly(styrene sulfonate) or with PSTFSI (b) above PEO melting temperature.

"Commercial lithium-ion cells with LiMn1/3Ni1/3Co1/3O2 as the positive electrode, graphite as the negative electrode and a LiPF6-EC:PC:DEC electrolyte were cycled under several conditions, and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the graphite electrode was studied. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed that LiPF6-EC:PC:DEC electrolyte was used in the cell and the relative volume ratio between solvents was acquired via quantitative NMR. Secondary ion mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a dual-beam focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope have been used to characterize the thickness, morphology and chemical composition of complex SEI on graphite anodes. The advantages and limitations of the characterization techniques are discussed and the results compared to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the SEI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Rechargeable Li battery cells were fabricated using a composite of crystalline V2O5 and polypyrrole (V2O5/PPy) as the positive electrode material and a gel electrolyte film based on cross-linked poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). The pure polypyrrole electrode and the conventional V2O5 electrode (V2O5/C), the latter of which was a mixture of V2O5, acetylene black, and Teflon(R) binder, were also used for comparison. The PMMA gel electrolyte, showing no liquid leakage even under pressure, was prepared when the amount of the electrolyte solution in the polymer gel was reduced to 65 wt %. The V2O5/PPy electrode in the battery cell showed a capacity density that was 98.4% of its capacity density obtained in the electrolyte solution. Repeat of charge-discharge tests caused capacity fading when the V2O5/C and the V2O5/PPy composite containing 91wt % oxide were used. However, no change in the capacity density was observed up to 50 cycles for the composite electrodes containing 84 and 60 wt % oxide and the pure polypyrrole electrode. AC impedance measurements were conducted by using a three-electrode system to obtain the interfacial properties between the positive electrode and the gel electrolyte. It was found that the interfacial resistance was largely increased by charge-discharge cycling when the electrodes showing definite capacity fading were used, but the stable electrodes did not show such behavior.

"A novel electrolyte concept for lithium-ion batteries, termed '' ionic liquid-in-salt '', is introduced. Our feasibility study on (1 - x) EMIMTFSI:(x) LiTFSI, 0.66 <= x <= 0.97, showed that at elevated temperatures the various dual liquid and solid phase regions are characterized by a wide thermal stability window, high ionic conductivities and appreciable mechanical integrity. The highest conductivity values are obtained for the compositions x = 0.70 and x = 0.75 (sigma approximate to 6 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)) and are related to the final melting of the materials. Overall, high conductivities are observed for 0.70 < x < 0.90 while low ones are found for x > 0.90. Raman and NMR spectroscopies reveal the presence of highly mobile Li-containing species, partly identified as [Li(TFSI)(2)](-), albeit rather unexpected for these high x values, which might explain the high ionic conductivities observed. To prove the general value of our concept in more detail, some first results on BMIMTFSI and PY13TFSI based systems are also presented.",0
"The ability to predict the solubility and stability of lithium polysulfide is vital in realizing longer lasting lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein we report combined experimental and computational analyses to understand the dissolution mechanism of lithium polysulfide species in an aprotic solvent medium. Multi-uclear NMR, variable temperature ESR and sulfur K-edge XAS analyses reveal that the lithium exchange between polysulfide species and solvent molecules constitutes the first step in the dissolution process. Lithium exchange leads to de-lithiated polysulfide ions (S-n(2-)) which subsequently form highly reactive free radicals through dissociation reaction (S-n(2-) -> 2S(n/2)(center dot-)). The energy required for the dissociation and possible dimer formation reactions of the polysulfide species is analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. Based on these findings, we discuss approaches to optimize the electrolyte in order to control the polysulfide solubility.",16
"Polymerized ionic liquids (PIL) are an interesting substance class, which is discussed to transfer the outstanding properties and tunability of ionic liquids into a solid material. In this study we extend our previous research on ammonium based PIL and discuss the influence of additives and their usability as polymer electrolyte membranes for lithium ion batteries. The polymer electrolyte is thereby used as replacement for the commercially widespread system of a separator that is soaked with liquid electrolyte. The influence of the material composition on the ionic conductivity (via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and the diffusion coefficients (via pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were studied and cell tests with adapted membrane materials were performed. High amounts of the additional ionic liquid (IL) MPPyrr-TFSI (1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) increased the ionic conductivity of the materials up to 1.3 center dot 10(-4) S center dot cm(-1) but made the usage of a cross-linker necessary to obtain mechanically stable membranes. The application of liquid electrolyte mixtures with ethylene carbonate (EC) and MPPyrr-TFSI decreased ionic conductivity values down to the 10(-9) S center dot cm(-1) range, but increased Li-7 diffusion coefficients with increasing amounts of EC up to 1.7 center dot 10(-10) m(2)center dot s(-1). Cell tests with two membrane mixtures proofed that it is possible to build electrolyte membranes on basis of the polymerized ionic liquids, but also showed that further research is necessary to ensure stable and efficient cell cycling.",14
"In this article, the formation constants of ionic pairs in salt-low molecular weight analogs of PEO (glyme, diglyme, triglyme) systems are estimated using NMR spectroscopy. The results from Li-7, B-11 and F-19 NMR titration are compared and the role of the nuclei studied is discussed. It is shown that even in the solvents of very similar coordination (in terms of the donor and acceptor number values) and dielectric properties, the ionic pair formation constant depends on solvent used. The role of the solvent is discussed in terms of effects related to ion agglomerate formation, non-covalent interactions between ions and liquid matrix as well as the number of interacting centers present in the molecules of the solvent. The discrepancies between the results obtained using various nuclei NMR as well as discrepancies between ion pair formation constant calculated for different experimental regimes are also analyzed.

"We report on the synthesis of poly(diethylene oxidealt-oxymethylene), P(2EO-MO), via cationic ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic ether monomer, 1,3,6-trioxocane. We use a combined experimental and computational approach to study ion transport in electrolytes comprising mixtures of P(2EO-MO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) salt. Mixtures of poly(ohylene oxide) (PEO) and LiTFSI are used as a baseline. The maximum ionic conductivities, a, of P(2EO-MO) and PEO electrolytes at 90 degrees C are 1.1 x 10(-3) and 1.5 x 10(-3) S/cm, respectively. This difference is attributed to the Tg of P(2EO-MO)/LiTFSI (-12 degrees C), which is significantly higher than that of PEO/LiTFSI (-44 degrees C) at the same salt concentration. Self-diffusion coefficients measured using pulsed-field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) show that both Li+ and TESI- ions diffuse more rapidly in PEO than in P(2EO-MO). However, the NMR-based cation transference number in P(2EO-MO) (0.36) is approximately twice that in PEO (0.19). The transference number measured by the steady-state current technique, t(+,ss) in P(2EO-MO) (0.20) is higher than in PEO (0.08) by a similar factor. We find that the product at sigma(t+ss), is greater in P(2-EO-MO) electrolytes; thus, P(2EO-MO) is expected to sustain higher steady-state currents under dc polarization, making it a more efficacious electrolyte for battery applications. Molecular-level insight into the factors that govern ion transport in our electrolytes was obtained using MD simulations. These simulations show that the solvation structures around Li' are similar in both polymers. The same is true for TFSI-. However, the density of Li+ solvation sites in P(2EO-MO) is double that in PEO. We posit that this is responsible for the observed differences in the experimentally determined transport properties of P(2EO-MO) and PEO electrolytes.",9
"In this article the properties of the electrolyte based on the product of the reaction of methylalumoxane with oligoethyleneglycols are examined. The electrochemical studies were performed to describe the conductivity and lithium transference number of the system. In addition, DSC, SEM, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy studies were used to get a more detailed description of the material. Three classes of electrolytes are here taken into consideration. The first based on the PEGDME liquid oligoether system modified with the MAO-PEGME branched heterocomposite system. The second one is the branched product itself used as an electrolyte matrix. In the last case a crosslinked system was obtained by the utilization of PEGME-PEG mixture. The conductivities obtained were in the range of 10(-4) S cm(-1) for liquid-like systems and above 10(-5) S cm(-1) for the solid ones. For samples containing LiCF3SO3 the lithium transference number was higher than 0.5 for some electrolyte compositions while it was in the range of 0.4 for ones containing LiClO4. Electrochemical stability of the system was preliminarily tested by means of cyclic voltammetry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",9
"Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SIPE) have attracted a lot of interest for application in high energy density lithium metal batteries. SIPEs possess lithium transport numbers close to unity, which does not provoke concentration gradients and holds the promise of limiting lithium dendrite formation. In this article, we have optimized a single-ion polymer incorporating the most successful chemical units in polymer electrolytes, such as ethylene oxide, carbonate, and a lithium sulfonimide. This single-ion poly(ethylene oxide carbonate) copolymer was synthesized by polycondensation between polyethylene glycol, dimethyl carbonate, and a functional diol including the pendant sulfonamide anionic group and the lithium counter-cation. By playing with the monomer stoichiometry, the crystallinity and ionic conductivity were optimized. The best copolymer showed high ionic conductivity values of 1.2x10(-4) S cm(-1) at 70 degrees C. Lithium interactions and mobility were studied by lithium-pulsed field gradient, lithium diffusion, NMR relaxation time measurements, and FTIR-ATR analysis. High lithium mobility is observed, which is due to the weakly coordinating chemical environment in the polymer and also that the sulfonamide in the SIPE adopts to a greater extent the cis conformation, which is known to promote lithium mobility. Finally, the performance of the singe-ion conducting poly(ethylene oxide carbonate) was compared in lithium symmetric cells versus an analogous conventional salt in polymer electrolyte, showing improved performance in lithium plating and stripping.",1
"The performance degradation and durability of a Li-ion battery is a major concern when it is operated under radiation conditions, for instance, in deep space exploration, in high radiation field, or rescuing or sampling equipment in a post-nuclear accident scenario. This paper examines the radiation effects on the electrode and electrolyte materials separately and their effects on a battery's capacity loss and resistance increase. A(60)Co irradiator (34.3 krad/h) was used to provide 0.8, 4.1, and 9.8 Mrad dose to LiFePO4 electrodes and 0.8,1.6, and 5.7 Mrad to 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 wt% EC:DMC electrolytes. This study shows that the coin cells assembled with irradiated components have higher failure rate (ca. 70%) than that of control group (ca. 14%). A significant battery capacity fade post irradiation was observed. The electrolyte also shows a darkened color a few weeks or months after irradiation. The discovery of this latent effect may be significant because a battery may degrade significantly even showing no sign of degradation immediately after exposure. We investigated electrolyte composition by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy prior and post irradiation. Polymerization reactions and HF formation are considered as the cause of the discoloration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Series of boron-complexed ion conducting dendritic electrolytes were prepared and suggested as 'cobweb' model. The hydroxyl functionalized Jeffamine (R) cored polyamidoamine (PAMAM) type dendrimers with various core size and generation were synthesized and their boron-cross linked form was obtained by using BH3-THF complex. During cross linking of the dendrimers, lithium trifluoromethane-sulfonate (CF3SO3Li) salt was added as dopants with different stoichiometric ratios. The structure and interactions of boron-cross linked dendritic electrolytes were investigated by using FT-IR. NMR and Thermograviimetric analysis (TGA). The ionic conductivities of these novel boron-cross linked dendritic electrolytes were studied by dielectric-impedance spectroscopy. Ionic conductivity of the dendritic electrolytes followed Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) relationships.

"Electrolytes consisting of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) dissolved in glymes (monoglyme, diglyme, and triglyme) were characterized by FT-Raman spectroscopy and C-13, O-17, and Na-23 NMR spectroscopy. The glyme:NaFSI molar ratio was varied from 50:1 to 1:1, and it was observed that, in the dilute electrolytes, the sodium salt is completely dissociated into solvent separated ion, pairs (SSIPs). However, contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) become the predominant 'species in more concentrated solutions. Some of the electrolytes with the highest concentrations, can be classified as solvate ionic liquids (SILs), where all of the solvent molecules are coordinated to sodium cations. Therefore, these electrolytes are fundamentally different from more dilute electrolytes which are typically used in commercially available secondary batteries. The melting point or glass transition temperature, dynamic viscosity, density, sodium concentration, and ionic conductivity of these solvate ionic liquids are reported as well as the crystal structures of [Na(G3)][FSI] and [Na(G3)(2)][FSI]. Galvanostatic cycling experiments were performed in coin-type cells with a Na-2/3[Mn0.55Ni0.30Co0.15]O-2 cathode to study the influence of these electrolytes on the electrochemical stability and charge/discharge behavior.",0
Tetramethylammonium bis(salicylo)borate was prepared via exchange reactions in alkaline solution.

"Magnesium–Sulfur batteries are one of most appealing options among the post-lithium battery systems due to its potentially high energy density, safe and sustainable electrode materials. The major practical challenges are originated from the soluble magnesium polysulfide intermediates and their shuttling between the electrodes, which cause high overpotentials, low sulfur utilization, and poor Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a functional Mo6S8 modified separator is designed to effectively address these issues. Both the experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that the electrochemically active Mo6S8 layer has a superior adsorption capability of polysulfides and simultaneously acts as a mediator to accelerate the polysulfide conversion kinetics. Remarkably, the magnesium–sulfur cell assembled with the functional separator delivers a high specific energy density (942.9 mA h g−1 in the 1st cycle) and can be cycled at 0.2 C for 200 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 96%. This work demonstrates a new design concept toward high-performance metal–sulfur batteries.",14
"Magnesium redox chemistry is a very appealing “beyond Li ion chemistry” for realizing high energy density batteries due to the high capacity, low reduction potential, and most importantly, highly reversible and dendrite-free Mg metal anode. However, the progress of rechargeable Mg batteries has been greatly hindered by shortage of electrolytes with wide stability window, high ionic conductivity, and good compatibility with cathode materials. Unlike solid electrolyte interphase on Li metal anode, surface film formed by electrolyte decomposition in Mg batteries was considered to block Mg ion transport and passivate Mg electrode. For this reason, the attention of the community has been mainly focusing on surface layer free electrolytes, while reductively unstable salts/solvents are barely considered, despite many of them possessing all the necessary properties for good electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the surface film formed by electrolyte decomposition can function as a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Using Mg/S chemistry as a model system, the SEI formation mechanism on Mg metal anode was thoroughly examined using electrochemical methods and surface chemistry characterization techniques such as EDX and XPS. On the basis of these results, a comprehensive view of the Mg/electrolyte interface that unifies both the SEI mechanism and the passivation layer mechanism is proposed. This new picture of surface layer on Mg metal anode in Mg batteries not only revolutionizes current understanding of Mg/electrolyte interface but also opens new avenues for electrolyte development by uncovering the potential of those reductively unstable candidates through interface design.",14
"Magnesium–sulfur batteries promise high volumetric energy density, enhanced safety, and low cost for electrochemical energy storage. The current obstacles to practical applications of reliable magnesium–sulfur batteries are finding electrolytes that can meet a multitude of rigorous requirements along with efficient sulfur cathodes and magnesium anodes. This review highlights recent advances in designing better electrolytes, cathodes, and anodes. A suitable electrolyte for magnesium–sulfur batteries should allow to reversibly electroplate/strip divalent magnesium ions and should be compatible with the sulfur cathode and the other cell's components. Another challenge to be addressed is the careful engineering of the interface and microstructure in the sulfur scaffold to effectively mitigate the soluble magnesium polysulfide shuttle and to enhance the reaction kinetics. We highlight that the ongoing research in this field encourages the fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the interplay among the different components by diverse characterization techniques.",14
"The Mg/S battery is attractive because of its high theoretical energy density and the abundance of Mg and S on the earth. However, its development is hindered by the lack of understanding to the underlying electrochemical reaction mechanism of its charge–discharge processes. Here, using a unique in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic tool, we systematically study the reaction pathways of the Mg/S cells in Mg(HMDS)2–AlCl3 electrolyte. We find that the capacity degradation is mainly due to the formation of irreversible discharge products, such as MgS and Mg3S8, through a direct electrochemical deposition or a chemical disproportionation of intermediate polysulfide. In light of the fundamental understanding, we propose to use TiS2 as a catalyst to activate the irreversible reaction of low-order MgSx and MgS, which results in an increased discharging capacity up to 900 mAh·g–1 and a longer cycling life.",14
"Superoxide based metal-air (or metal-oxygen) batteries, including potassium and sodium-oxygen batteries, have emerged as promising alternative chemistries in the metal-air battery family because of much improved round-trip efficiencies (>90%). In order to improve the cycle life of these batteries, it is crucial to understand and control the side reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte. For potassium-oxygen batteries using ether-based electrolytes, the side reactions on the potassium anode have been identified as the main cause of battery failure. The composition of the side products formed on the anode, including some reaction intermediates, have been identified and quantified. Combined experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the side reactions are likely driven by the interaction of potassium with ether molecules and the crossover of oxygen from the cathode. To inhibit these side reactions, the incorporation of a polymeric potassium ion selective membrane (Nafion-K+) as a battery separator is demonstrated that significantly improves the battery cycle life. The K-O-2 battery with the Nafion-K+ separator can be discharged and charged for more than 40 cycles without increases in charging overpotential.",1
"The combination of sulfur (S) as cathode with a Mg anode is a promising approach for batteries because of the high theoretical capacity (1672 mA h g−1) as well as the abundance and relatively low cost of these elements. However, up to now Mg/S batteries face serious drawbacks like a large overpotential between charge/discharge cycles, rapid capacity fading, poor cycling efficiency and slow kinetics, etc. Most of these problems are strongly correlated with polysulfide dissolution in the electrolyte and their subsequent shuttling to the Mg anode side. In this work, we investigate the Mg2+ deposition/dissolution process on a Mg metal electrode using a non-nucleophilic magnesium electrolyte (0.4 M Mg[B(hfip)4]2/DME) in the presence or absence of polysulfides. The large overpotential increase of the Mg metal anode in the presence of polysulfide species is reduced by the addition of optimum concentration of iodine additives to the Mg electrolyte, which help in the formation of a favorable, less corrosive, uniform and stable interfacial layer. In addition to the electrochemical studies, this work examines the chemical composition, thickness and morphology of the interphase layer formed on Mg metal by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with depth profiling and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) techniques. Furthermore, the stability of different MgX phases (X = S, I2 and F2) formed between the Mg metal anode and different additive containing electrolytes and Mg diffusion through these interphases are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",14
"Metallic Mg is a promising anode material for rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) due to its low electrochemical potential and high theoretical capacity. However, low Mg2+ conductivity on the interface of Mg electrode caused by liquid electrolyte passivation hinders its development. In addition, whether Mg dendrites can be formed in Mg metal anodes is controversial. Herein, we find that Mg dendrites can be formed in Mg metal anodes. The diameter of most Mg dendrites is below 100 nm, which is much smaller than Li and Na dendrites. The nanoscale Mg dendrites can easily pierce through the separators with large pore size and cause the internal short circuit of batteries. A simple strategy is proposed to address the issues of Mg metal anodes by painting a liquid metal Ga layer on Mg foil. Metallic Ga can spontaneously alloy with metallic Mg to form a stable, Mg2+-conductive, corrosive-resistant, and magnesiophilic Ga5Mg2 alloy layer. Under the regulation of the Ga5Mg2 alloy layer, a highly reversible, stable, and dendrite-free Mg metal anode is obtained. Enhanced electrochemical performance is achieved both in symmetric cells and Mg-S full cells. This study paves the way for high-energy Mg-metal batteries.",14
"As next-generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high-voltage resistance and a long lifespan. Electrolyte engineering is a facile yet effective strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs, In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle-concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion-rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultra-high without thermal runaway, high-voltage stability, high-temperature stability and excellent ternary-cathode compatibility. Novel gem-difluorinated cations firstly synthesised for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner-Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li+ solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li+ solvation structure including anions-solvents and ionic liquids (IL) cations-solvents pairs are firstly revealed via two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) in the bulk electrolyte, which are beneficial for promoting an anion-dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process demonstrated by theoretical calculation. Benefiting from the unique anion-rich solvation structure, a stable hetero SEI structure with a fluorine-rich mixed outer layer and an inorganic inner layer is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high-voltage ternary-cathode at high temperatures (60°C) and high voltages (4.5V). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations. This article is protected by copyright.

"Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation batteries. However, the popularization of RMBs is seriously plagued due to the lack of suitable non-nucleophilic electrolytes and the passivation of Mg anode. Herein, a novel non-nucleophilic electrolyte is developed by introducing (s)-1-methoxy-2-propylamine (M4) into themagnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC)-like electrolyte. The as-synthesizes Mg(AlCl4)2-IL-DME-M4 electrolyte enables robust reversible cycling of Mg plating/stripping with low overpotential, high anodic stability, and ionic conductivity (8.56 mS cm−1). These features should be mainly attributed to the in situ formation of an MgF2 containing Mg2+-conducting interphase, which dramatically suppresses the passivation and parasitic reaction of Mg anode with electrolyte. Remarkably, the Mg/S batteries assemble with as-synthesize electrolyte and a new type MoS2@CMK/S cathode deliver unprecedented electrochemical performance. Specifically, the Mg/S battery exhibited the highest reversible capacity up to 1210 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability and satisfactory long-term cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 370 mAh g−1 (coulombic efficiency of ≈100%) at 1.0 C for 600 cycles. The study findings provide a novel strategy and inspiration for designing efficient non-nucleophilic Mg electrolyte and suitable sulfur-host materials for practical Mg/S battery applications.",14
"The rechargeable magnesium (Mg) battery has been considered a promising candidate for future battery generations due to unique advantages of the Mg metal anode. The combination of Mg with a sulfur cathode is one of the attractive electrochemical energy storage systems that use safe, low-cost, and sustainable materials and could potentially provide a high energy density. To develop a suitable electrolyte remains the key challenge for realization of a magnesium sulfur (Mg–S) battery. Herein, we demonstrate that magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate Mg[B(hfip)4]2 (hfip = OC(H)(CF3)2) satisfies a multitude of requirements for an efficient and practical electrolyte, including high anodic stability (>4.5 V), high ionic conductivity (∼11 mS cm–1), and excellent long-term Mg cycling stability with a low polarization. Insightful mechanistic studies verify the reversible redox processes of Mg–S chemistry by utilizing Mg[B(hfip)4]2 electroylte and also unveil the origin of the voltage hysteresis in Mg–S batteries.",14
"Due to its high theoretical energy density and relative abundancy of active materials, the magnesium–sulfur battery has attracted research attention in recent years. A closely related system, the lithium-sulfur battery, can suffer from serious self-discharge behavior. Until now, the self-discharge of Mg–S has been rarely addressed. Herein, we demonstrate for a wide variety of Mg–S electrolytes and conditions that Mg–S batteries also suffer from serious self-discharge. For a common Mg–S electrolyte, we identify a multi-step self-discharge pathway. Covalent S8 diffuses to the metal Mg anode and is converted to ionic Mg polysulfide in a non-faradaic reaction. Mg polysulfides in solution are found to be meta-stable, continuing to react and precipitate as solid magnesium polysulfide species during both storage and active use. Mg–S electrolytes from the early, middle, and state-of-the-art stages of the Mg–S literature are all found to enable the self-discharge. The self-discharge behavior is found to decrease first cycle discharge capacity by at least 32%, and in some cases up to 96%, indicating this is a phenomenon of the Mg–S chemistry that deserves focused attention.",14
"Lithium poly(pyromellitic acid borate) (PPAB) was synthesized via polymerization of lithium tetramethanolatoborate and silylated pyromellitic acid. The synthesized material was characterized by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, B-11 nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. And electrochemical characterizations were carried out on the blended PPAB/PVDF-HFP membrane. The PPAB-based composite membrane exhibits high lithium ionic conductivity, a broad electrochemical window and a high lithium-ion transference number. The battery cells assembled with the PPAB/PVDF-HFP/EC:PC composite membrane as the electrolyte perform reasonably well not only at elevated temperature but also at room temperature with good cyclability and discharge capacity, making the material suitable for applications in lithium-ion batteries.",1
"The structural characterization and properties of lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) are reported. LiDFOB was synthesized as previously described in the literature via direct reaction of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate with lithium oxalate. The crystal structure of the salt was determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction yielding a highly symmetric orthorhombic structure (Cmcm, a=6.2623(8)angstrom, b=11.4366(14)angstrom.c = 6.3002(7)angstrom, V=451.22(9)angstrom(3),Z=4 at 110 K). Single crystal X-ray diffraction of a dihydrate of LiDFOB yielded a monoclinic structure (P2(1/c),a =9.5580(3)angstrom, b=12.7162(4)angstrom, c=5.4387(2)angstrom, V=634.63(4)angstrom(3), Z=4 at 110K). Along with the crystal structures, additional structural information and the properties of LiDFOB (via B-11 and F-19 NMR, DSC, TGA and Raman spectroscopy) have been compared with those of LiBF4 and LiBOB to better understand the differences between these lithium battery electrolyte salts.

"A new class offluorine-free ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes based on aliphatic flexibleoligoether anions, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetate (MEA) and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetate (MEEA), coupled with pyrrolidinium and imidazolium cations is introduced. For the ILs with MEEAanions, Li+conducting electrolytes are created by doping the ILs with 30 mol% of LiMEEA. The structural flexibility of the oligoether functionality in the anion results in glass transition temperatures (Tg) as low as-60 C for the neat ILs and the electrolytes. The imidazolium-based ILs and electrolytes reveal better thermal stabilities but higherTgand lower electrochemical stabilities than the corresponding pyrrolidinium-based analogues. All neat ILs show comparable transport properties for the cations and these decrease by the addition of lithium salt-the pyrrolidinium-based electrolyte being affected the most.",0
"Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) have been employed to study the thermal stability of the chitosan acetate-based polymer electrolyte films. The glass transition temperature, T-g measurements confirm the conductivity enhancement effect by adding the plasticizer and salt in the chitosan acetate films",15
"Silicon anodes usually endure low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) in applications for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), although the volume expansion and structural stability has been greatly improved under many efforts in the recent years. During the first charge and discharge, a large number of lithium ions can participate in the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on anode surface, such as LiF, Li(2)CO(3)and many Li-based compounds, resulting in low efficiency, particularly as the nano-sized silicon is widely applied to solve the volume effect. Herein, we find that the lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO2F2, LiDFP) additive shows some special properties, which greatly improve the reversible capacity in the first discharge. The silicon nanoparticles can deliver an ICE of 70.6 % with 2 wt% LiDFP in the electrolyte, which is increased by 17.7 % compared with the cell without LiDFP (ca. 52.9 %). By comparing the XPS and NMR results, it appears the LiDFP may reduce the number of lithium ions involved in the SEI reaction in the electrolyte during the first discharge, and thus the ICE can be improved.",1
"The trend of research towards more sustainable materials is pushing the application of biopolymers in a variety of unexplored fields. In this regard, hydrogels are attracting significant attention as electrolytes for flexible electrochemical devices thanks to their combination of ionic conductivity and mechanical properties. In this context, we present the use of cellulose-based hydrogels as aqueous electrolytes for electrochemical devices. These materials were obtained by crosslinking of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) with divinyl sulfone (DVS) in the presence of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), creating a semi-IPN structure. The reaction was confirmed by NMR and FTIR. The small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) technique revealed that the rheological properties could be conveniently varied by simply changing the gel composition. Additionally, the hydrogels presented high ionic conductivity in the range of mS cm(-1). The ease of synthesis and processing of the hydrogels allowed the assembly of an all-in-one electrochromic device (ECD) with high transmittance variation, improved switching time and good color efficiency. On the other hand, the swelling ability of the hydrogels permits the tuning of the electrolyte to improve the performance of a printed Zinc/MnO2 primary battery. The results prove the potential of cellulose-based hydrogels as electrolytes for more sustainable electrochemical devices.",0
"Aluminum-based batteries are a promising alternative to lithium-ion as they are considered to be low-cost and more friendly to the environment. In addition, aluminum is abundant and evenly distributed across the globe. Many studies and Al battery prototypes use imidazolium chloroaluminate electrolytes because of their good rheological and electrochemical performance. However, these electrolytes are very expensive, and so cost is a barrier to industrial scale-up. A urea-based electrolyte, AlCl3:Urea, has been proposed as an alternative, but its performance is relatively poor because of its high viscosity and low conductivity. This type of electrolyte has become known as an ionic liquid analogue (ILA). In this contribution, we proposed two Lewis base salt precursors, namely, guanidine hydrochloride and acetamidine hydrochloride, as alternatives to the urea-based ILA. We present the study of three ILAs, AlCl3:Guanidine, AlCl3:Acetamidine, and AlCl3:Urea, examining their rheology, electrochemistry, NMR spectra, and coin-cell performance. The room temperature viscosities of both AlCl3:Guanidine (52.9 cP) and AlCl3:Acetamidine (76.0 cP) were significantly lower than those of the urea-based liquid (240.9 cP), and their conductivities were correspondingly higher. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) showed that all three electrolytes exhibit reversible deposition/dissolution of Al, but LSV indicated that AlCl3:Guanidine and AlCl3:Acetamidine ILAs have superior anodic stability compared to the AlCl3:Urea electrolyte, as evidenced by anodic potential limits of +2.23 V for both AlCl3:Guanidine and AlCl3:Acetamidine and +2.12 V for AlCl3:Urea. Coin-cell tests showed that both AlCl3:Guanidine and AlCl3:Acetamidine ILA exhibit a higher Coulombic efficiency (98 and 97%, respectively) than the AlCl3:Urea electrolyte system, which has an efficiency of 88% after 100 cycles at 60 mA g(-1). Overall, we show that AlCl3:Guanidine and AlCl3:Acetamidine have superior performance when compared to AlCl3:Urea, while maintaining low economic cost. We consider these to be valuable alternative materials for Al-based battery systems, especially for commercial production.",0
"A novel, low cost and environmentally sustainable lithium sulfide-carbon composite cathode, suitably prepared by combining polyethylene oxide (PEO), LiCF3SO3 and Li2S-C powders is presented herein. The cathode is characterized in a lithium-metal cell employing a solution of LiCF3SO3 salt in dioxolane-dimethylether (DOL: DME) as the electrolyte. The detailed NMR investigation of the diffusion properties of the electrolyte is reported in order to determine its suitability for the proposed cell. The addition of LiNO3 to the electrolyte solution allows its practical application in a lithium sulfur cell using an Li2S-C-based cathode characterized by a specific capacity of about 500 mA h g(-1) (with respect to the Li2S mass). The cell holds its optimal performances for over 70 cycles at a C/5 rate, with a steady state efficiency approaching 99%. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the cell upon operation suggest the reversibility of the Li2S electrochemical process, while the repeated electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicate the suitability of the electrode-electrolyte interface in terms of low and stable cell impedance. Furthermore, the EIS study clarifies the activation process occurring at the Li2S cathode during the first charge process, leading to a decrease of cell polarization during the following cycles. The data reported here shed light on important aspects which should be considered for the efficient application of a Li2S cathode in lithium batteries.",15
"Aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) battery is a promising candidate of next generation rechargeable batteries owing to its high theoretical energy density, high safety and low cost, but currently greatly impeded by the shortage of high-performance and cost-effective electrolytes. In this work, a low-cost deep eutectic solvent, i.e., AlCl3/acetamide, as the electrolyte for reversible room-temperature Al-S battery has been reported. The Al-S battery delivers an initial capacity above 1500 mA h g−1 and good rate performance, which is most probably caused by the presence of AlCl4−, Al2Cl7− and [AlCl2·(acetamide)2]+ ions as indicated by spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the discharged sulfur cathode suggests the presence of aluminum sulfides including Al2S3 as electrochemical conversion products. Density functional theory calculations on the energy barriers provide insights into the electrochemical reaction pathways. This AlCl3/acetamide based Al-S battery presents a promising prospect for high-performance and low-cost energy storage system in future.",7
"We report the electrochemical intercalation–extraction of aluminum (Al) in the layered TiS2 and spinel-based cubic Cu0.31Ti2S4 as the potential cathode materials for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrate the feasibility of reversible Al intercalation in both titanium sulfides with layered TiS2 showing better properties. The crystallographic study sheds light on the possible Al intercalation sites in the titanium sulfides, while the results from galvanostatic intermittent titration indicate that the low Al3+ diffusion coefficients in the sulfide crystal structures are the primary obstacle to facile Al intercalation–extraction.",5
"Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as promising candidates for post-lithium-ion batteries due to their lack of flammability and electrochemical performance comparable to other metal-ion batteries. The lack of suitable cathode materials, however, has hindered the development of high-performing AIBs. Sulfur is a cost-efficient material, having distinguished electrochemical properties, and is considered an attractive cathode material for AIBs. Several pioneering reports have shown that aluminum-sulfur batteries (ASBs) exhibit superior electrochemical capacity over other cathode materials for AIBs. However, a rapid decay in the capacity is a huge barrier for their practical applications. Here, we have demonstrated systematically for the first time that the two-dimensional layered materials (e.g. MoS2, WS2, and BN) can serve as fixers of S and sulfide compounds during repeated charge/discharge processes; BN/S/C displays the highest capacity of 532 mAh g−1 (at a current density of 100 mA g−1) compared with the current state-of-the-art cathode material for AIBs. Further, we could improve the life-span of ASBs to an unprecedented 300 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 94.3%; discharge plateaus at ~1.15 V vs. AlCl4−/Al was clearly observed during repeated charge/discharge cycling. We believe that this work opens up a new method for achieving high-performing ASBs.",5
"High-performance rechargeable aluminum-sulfur batteries (RASB) have great potential for various applications owing to their high theoretical capacity, abundant sulfur resources, and good safety. Nevertheless, the practical application of RASB still faces several challenges, including the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon and low sulfur utilization efficiency. Here, we first developed a synergistic copper heterogeneous metal oxide MoO2 derived from polymolybdate-based metal-organic framework as an efficient catalyst for mitigating polysulfide diffusion. This composite enhances sulfur utilization and electrical conductivity of the cathode. DFT calculations and experimental results reveal the catalyst Cu/MoO2@C not only effectively anchors aluminum polysulfides (AlPSs) to mitigate the shuttle effect, but also significantly promotes the catalytic conversion of AlPSs on the sulfur cathode side during charging and discharging. The unique nanostructure contains abundant electrocatalytic active sites of oxide nanoparticles and Cu clusters, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. Consequently, the established RASB exhibits an initial capacity of 875 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and maintains a capacity of 967 mAh g−1 even at a high temperature of 50 °C.",7
"An aluminum–ion battery comprised of fluorinated natural graphite cathode, aluminum anode and AlCl3 containing imidazolium based ionic liquid as electrolyte is reported for the first time.

"Many parameters may control the growth and the characteristics of the interphase, such as surface structure and morphology, structural defects, grain boundaries, surface reactions, etc. However, polycrystalline surfaces contain these parameters simultaneously, resulting in a quite complicated system to study. Working with model electrode surfaces using crystallographically oriented crystalline thin films appears as a novel and unique approach to understand contributions of preferential orientation and rugosity of the surface. In order to rebuild the interphase architecture along electrochemical cycling, LiFePO4 epitaxial films offering ideal 2D (100) interfaces are here investigated through the use of non-destructive depth profiling by Angular Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARXPS). The composition and structure of the interphase is then monitored upon cycling for samples stopped at the end of charge and discharge for various numbers of cycles, and discussed in the light of combined XPS and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements. Such an approach allows describing the interphase evolution on a specific model LiFePO4 crystallographic orientation and helps understanding the nature and evolution of the LiFePO4 /electrolyte interphase forming on the surface of LiFePO4 poly-crystalline powder.",4
"Li2OHCl is considered to act as a suitable Li+ ionic conductor that is, excluding Li, solely composed of rather abundant elements. Its low meting point allows rather easy synthesis methods to prepare Li2OHCl in large quantities. So far, only few studies tackled the problem to deliver a clear-cut picture of Li+ self-diffusion. Li+ hopping in Li2OHCl is suggested to be coupled to OH- rotational dynamics. Proving such an interdependent coupling beyond any doubt remains, however, challenging. Here, we observed diffusion-induced 7Li and 1H NMR spin-lattice relaxation in both the laboratory and rotating frame of reference to find out (i) whether Li+ displacements are caused by fast OH- motions or (ii) whether anisotropic rotational OH- dynamics is a consequence of the rapid Li+ translational processes. By considering 7Li and 1H NMR line shapes and comparing our results with those obtained from conductivity spectroscopy as well as from recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and 2H NMR by Dawson et al., Energy. Environ. Sci. 2018, 11, 2993-3002, we propose that OH- rotational dynamics could also be a consequence rather than the trigger for fast Li+ self-diffusion (0.41 eV) on the NMR time scale.",2
"The present study reports on the characterisation of the structure and properties of 50Li(2)O center dot xAl(2)O(3)center dot(50-x)P2O5 glasses. The objective of the work has been to study the influence of the alumina content on the properties of lithium phosphate glasses, and the room temperature ionic conductivity in particular, with potential application as solid electrolytes in lithium secondary batteries. The glass formation domain has been also determined, proving that Al2O3 can be introduced only up to 5 mol%, The addition of alumina results in the increase of the glass transition temperature and decrease of the molar volume of the glasses. Furthermore, both chemical durability and room temperature conductivity increase as a function of the alumina content. The structure of the glasses has been followed by means of Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy, which has been used to establish the structure-properties relationship.

"Direct tracking of lithium ions with time and spatial resolution can provide an important diagnostic tool for understanding mechanisms in lithium ion batteries. A fluorescent indicator of lithium ions, 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)naphthoxazole, was synthesized and used for real-time tracking of lithium ions via widefield fluorescence microscopy. The fluorophore can be excited with visible light and was shown to enable quantitative determination of the lithium ion diffusion constant in a microfluidic model system for a plasticized polymer electrolyte lithium battery. The use of widefield fluorescence microscopy for in situ tracking of lithium ions in batteries is discussed.",10
"In order to expand our understanding of a potential zinc-based battery electrolyte, we have characterized the physical and transport properties of the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide ([C(4)mpyr][dca]) containing various levels of both Zn2+ and H2O. Detailed measurements of density, viscosity, conductivity, and individual anion and cation diffusion coefficients using pulsed-field-gradient (PFG) NMR combined with NMR chemical shifts and spin-lattice relaxation (T-1) NMR experiments provide insights into the motion and chemical environment of all molecular species. We find that the various techniques for probing ion transport and dynamics form a coherent picture as a function of electrolyte composition. Zn2+ addition causes a moderate reduction in the self-diffusion of the IL anion and cation, whereas the addition of H2O increases ion mobility by increasing the liquid's overall fluidity. Temperature-dependent C-13 T-1 experiments of the dca carbon analyzed using Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound fits show monotonic slowing of anion dynamics with Zn2+ addition, suggesting increased Zn2+/dca(-) association. T, experiments show minimal change in the spin-lattice relaxation of cation or anion upon H2O addition, suggesting that H2O is playing no significant role in Zn2+ speciation. Finally, we employ a novel electrophoretic NMR technique to directly determine the electrophoretic mobility of the C(4)mpyr cation, which we discuss in the context of impedance-based conductivity measurements.",9
"We have investigated the charge transport dynamics of a novel solid-like electrolyte material based on mixtures of the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMIM] TFSI) and various concentrations of lithium salt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) confined within a SiO2 matrix, prepared via a sol-gel method. The translational diffusion coefficients of BMIM+, TFSI-, and Li+ in ILs and confined ILs (ionogels, IGs) with different concentrations of lithium salt have been measured at variable temperatures, covering the 20-100 degrees C range, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) pulsed field gradient diffusion spectroscopy. The mobility of BMIM+, TFSI-, and Li+ was found to increase with the [BMIM] TFSI/LiTFSI ratio, exhibiting an almost liquid-like mobility in IGs. Additionally, the effect of confinement on IL rotational dynamics has been analyzed by measuring H-1, F-19, and Li-7 spin-lattice relaxation rate dispersions of IGs at different temperatures, using fast field-cycling NMR relaxometry. The analysis of the experimental data was performed assuming the existence of two fractions of the liquid: a bulk fraction (at least several ionic radii from the silica particles) and a surface fraction (close to the silica particles) and using two different models based on translational and rotational diffusion and reorientation mediated by translational displacements. The existence and weighting of these two fractions of ions were obtained from the direct diffusion measurements. The results show that the ion dynamics slowed only modestly under confinement, which evidences that IGs preserve IL transport properties, and this behavior is an encouraging indication for using IGs as a solid electrolyte for Li+ batteries.",2
"Understanding the transport property of Li ions is crucial for improving the performance of Li-ion batteries. To investigate the ion diffusion at high temperatures, we constructed a high-temperature pulsed-field-gradient (PFG) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe capable of measurements at temperatures >700 K. The accuracy of the sample temperature was confirmed via Br-79 NMR measurements of KBr. Li-7 PFG-NMR measurements of Li2CO3 were performed at temperatures up to 724 K using the probe. The apparent diffusion coefficient of Li ions in Li2CO3 was obtained experimentally.",8
"Magnesium polysulfides have a key role during the redox reaction in magnesium-sulfur batteries. However, kinetics of the Mg polysulfide disproportionation, transport, and solubility in electrolytes are rarely studied. To fill this gap, we here report the synthesis of different chain-length Mg polysulfides and their characterization with H-1 NMR, ATR-IR, and XANES spectroscopies. The tendency of polysulfides to disproportionate in solutions is confirmed with UV/Vis spectroscopy. To probe their reactivity and diffusivity, impedance spectroscopy is performed in symmetrical cells consisting of two planar glassy carbon or porous carbon electrodes containing Mg polysulfide catholyte. Several transport-reaction parameters are obtained, such as exchange current densities, chemical diffusion coefficients, transference numbers of polysulfides, and conductivities. Moreover, we show that the solubility of Mg polysulfides in Mg(TFSI)(2), MgCl2 ether-based electrolyte is affected at rather moderate concentration of polysulfides, thereby having an impact on the cell performance.",8
"Two sulfonated ionomers based on poly(triethylmethyl ammonium 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS) and containing mixtures of Li+ and quaternary ammonium cations are characterised. The first system contains Li+ and the methyltriethyl ammonium cation (N-1222) in a 1:9 molar ratio, and the Li-7 NMR line widths showed that the Li+ ions are mobile in this system below the glass transition temperature (105 degrees C) and are therefore decoupled from the polymer segmental motion. The conductivity in this system was measured as 10(-5) 5 cm(-1) at 130 degrees C. A second PAMPS system containing Li+ and the dimethylbutylmethoxyethyl ammonium cation (N-114(201)) in a 2: 8 molar ratio showed much lower conductivities despite a significantly lower T-g (60 degrees C), possibly due to associations between the Li+ and the ether group on the ammonium cation, or between the latter cations and the sulfonate groups.

"The thermal reaction of ternary electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1: 1: 1 ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate) with mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) particles was investigated by the combined use of NMR, GC-MS, FTIR-ATR, TGA, XPS and SEM/EDS-element map. The thermal decomposition of ternary electrolyte is not inhibited by the presence of MCMB particles. The chemical composition and morphology of the surface of MCMB particles changes significantly upon storage in the presence of ternary electrolyte. Electrolyte decomposition products including oligocarbonates, oligoethylene oxides, polyethylene oxide (PEO), lithium fluorophosphates (LixPOyFz), and lithium fluoride are deposited on the surface of MCMB particles. The concentration of decomposition products on the surface of MCMB increases with increased storage time and temperature.

"The formation and the evolution of lithium-containing species on the surface of grains of a layered 4V material such as LiNi1/2Mn1/2O2 along the electrochemical cycling have been followed using Li-7 MAS NMR, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and XPS. Materials displaying different specific surface areas and stored in different atmospheres have been investigated in order to study the influence of the surface/volume ratio and the influence of the initial surface state, respectively. It is shown that the presence of an initial interphase of Li2CO3 influences the electrochemical behavior of the electrode, emphasizing the importance of the history of the electrode prior cycling. Li-7 MAS NMR experiments performed upon cycling indicate the formation of interphase species in reduction and their partial removal in oxidation, indicating the dynamic character of the interphase upon cycling. Combined NMR, EIS and XPS experiments show the strong influence of the electrode/electrolyte interphase evolution on the electrochemical performance. Such results lead us to draw conclusions on the optimal storage conditions of layered 4V materials for Li-ion batteries such as LiNi1/2Mn1/2O2. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"A polyvinylidene fluoride-graft-polyacrylonitrile (PVDF-g-PAN) copolymer was prepared by ozone polymerization and characterized by H-1-NMR. The as-prepared copolymer is a hybrid with polyethylene oxide (PEO), named m-PVDF, and was applied as a conductive gel-polymer electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries. According to morphology analysis, the m-PVDF membrane has less microphase separation than the PVDF blending with the PAN and PEO system (b-PVDF) which means that the PVDF-g-PAN copolymer can increase the compatibility of PVDF and PEO polymers. From the DSC analysis, introduction of PVDF-g-PAN effectively decreases the crystallinity of the PEO polymer in the m-PVDF membrane, which assists in lithium-ion transport. Moreover, m-PVDF shows high thermal stability up to 400 degrees C and good dimensional-stability under 150 degrees C, which can prevent the batteries from short-cutting and burning as well as other safety problems at high temperature. For battery application, the membrane shows good electrochemical stability up to 5 V (vs. Li/Li+). Furthermore, cells incorporating the m-PVDF membrane demonstrated remarkably excellent capacity retention with a capacity decay of only 9.1% after 300 cycles. Accordingly, these results suggest that the introduced PVDF-g-PAN significantly improved the electrolyte compatibility, thermal properties and wettability of the membrane, yielding a high-performance and high-safety electrolyte.",12
"The redox-active bis(imino)acenapthene (BIAN) ligand was used to synthesize homoleptic aluminum, chromium, and gallium complexes of the general formula (BIAN)(3)M. The resulting compounds were characterized using X-ray crystallography, NMR, EPR, magnetic susceptibility and cyclic voltammetry measurements and modeled using both DFT and ab initio wavefunction calculations to compare the orbital contributions of main group elements and transition metals in ligand-based redox events. Complexes of this type have the potential to improve the energy density and electrolyte stability of grid-scale energy storage technologies, such as redox flow batteries, through thermodynamically-clustered redox events.",0
"In this study, a series of nanocomposite polymer electrolytes (NCPEs) with high conductivity and lithium ion transference number, PEO/LiClO4/SAP, were prepared from high molecular weight polyethylene oxide (PEO), LiClO4 and low content of homemade silica aerogel powder (SAP), which had higher surface area and pore volume than the conventional silica particle. From the SEM images it was found that the SAP nanoparticles were well dispersed in the PEO polymer electrolyte matrix. The characterization and interactions in the CPEs were studied by DSC, XRD, Fr-IR and Li-7 NMR analysis. The ac impedance results showed that the ionic conductivity of the CPE was significantly improved by the addition of the as-prepared SAP. The maximum ambient ionic conductivity obtained from the CPE with EO/Li = 6 and 2 wt.% of SAP (O6A2) was about threefold higher than that of the corresponding polymer electrolyte without SAP (O6). In addition, the lithium ion transference number (t(+)) of O6A2 at 70 degrees C was as high as 0.67, which was also three times higher than that of O6 and has not been previously reported for the PEO-LiX-based polymer electrolytes.

"Li4Ti5O12/TiO2 nanocomposites are synthesized by a sol-gel method. The size of Li4Ti5O12 and TiO2 particles is of 4-5 and 7-10 nm, respectively. The obtained materials are characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM and BET. Ion mobility of the composites and their performance as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries are studied. According to the conductivity and Li-7 NMR data, Li+ mobility is much higher in the Li4Ti5O12/TiO2 nanocomposites as compared with that in pure Li4Ti5O12. For Li4Ti5O12/TiO2 nanocomposites, marked changes in the charge discharge curves are observed; charge discharge rate and effective capacity at a high cycling rate are shown to increase. During the first cycle, charge capacity of these materials surpasses the theoretical capacity of Li4Ti5O12. However, this parameter decreases sharply with cycling, whereas the discharge capacity remains almost unchanged. This phenomenon is attributed to the solid electrolyte interphase formation due to a partial electrolyte reduction on the Li4Ti5O12/TiO2 composite surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Improving the reversibility of lithium metal batteries is one of the challenges in current battery research. This requires better fundamental understanding of the evolution of the lithium deposition morphology, which is very complex due to the various parameters involved in different systems. Here, we clarify the fundamental origins of lithium deposition coverage in achieving highly reversible and compact lithium deposits, providing a comprehensive picture in the relationship between the lithium microstructure and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for lithium metal batteries. Systematic variation of the salt concentration offers a framework that brings forward the different aspects that play a role in cycling reversibility. Higher nucleation densities are formed in lower concentration electrolytes, which have the advantage of higher lithium deposition coverage; however, it goes along with the formation of an organic-rich instable SEI which is unfavorable for the reversibility during (dis)charging. On the other hand, the growth of large deposits benefiting from the formation of an inorganic-rich stable SEI is observed in higher concentration electrolytes, but the initial small nucleation density prevents full coverage of the current collector, thus compromising the plated lithium metal density. Taking advantages of the paradox, a nanostructured substrate is rationally applied, which increases the nucleation density realizing a higher deposition coverage and thus more compact plating at intermediate concentration (similar to 1.0 M) electrolytes, leading to extended reversible cycling of batteries.",0
"There is urgent action required for replacing LiPF6 as a solute for Li-ion batteries electrolytes. This salt, prone to highly Lewis acidic PF5 release and hydrolysis to HF is responsible for deleterious reaction on carbonate solvents, corrosion of electrode materials leading to safety problems then release to toxic chemicals. A major advantage of LiPF6 is that it passivates aluminium. Most attempts to replace LiPF6 with hydrolytically-stable salts have been unsuccessful because of Al corrosion.We present here two Huckel type salts, namely lithium (2-fluoroalkyl-4,5-dicyano-imidazolate); fluoroalkyle = CF3 (TDI), C2F5 (PDI) with high charge delocalization. These thermally stable salts give both appreciably conductive solutions in EC/DMC (>6 mS cm(-1) at 20 degrees C) with a lower decrease with temperature than LiPF6. Non fluorinated lithium (4,5-dicyano-1,2,3-triazolate) is comparatively less than half as conductive. The lithium transference number T, measured by PFG-NMR is also higher. Voltammetry scans with either platinum or aluminium electrodes show an oxidation wall at 4.6 V versus Li+:Li degrees. These two salts are thus the first examples of strictly covalent, non-corroding salts allowing 4+V electrode material operation. This is demonstrated with experimental Li/LiMn2O4 cells as beyond the third cycles, the fade of the three electrolytes were quasi-identical, though LiPF6 had a sharper initial decrease.

"Directional correlations between the movements of cations and anions exert a strong influence on the charge and mass transport properties of concentrated battery electrolytes. Here, we combine, for the first time, very-low-frequency impedance spectroscopy on symmetrical Li vertical bar electrolyte vertical bar Li cells with diffusion and electrophoretic NMR in order to quantify cation-cation, anion-anion and cation-anion correlations in Li salt/tetraglyme (G4) mixtures with Li salt to G4 ratios between 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. We find that all correlations are negative, with like-ion anticorrelations (cation-cation and anion-anion) being generally stronger than cation-anion anticorrelations. In addition, we observe that like-ion anticorrelations are stronger for the heavier type of ion and that all anticorrelations become weaker with decreasing Li salt to G4 ratio. These findings are in contrast to theories considering exclusively anion-cation correlations in form of ion pairs, as the latter imply positive cation-anion correlations. We analyze in detail the influence of anticorrelations on Li+ transference numbers and on the Haven ratio. In order to rationalize our results, we derive linear response theory expressions for all ion correlations. These expressions show that the Li+ ion transport under anion-blocking conditions in a battery is governed by equilibrium center-of-mass fluctuations in the electrolytes. This suggests that in future electrolyte theories and computer simulations, more attention should be paid to equilibrium center-of-mass fluctuations.",0
"In this work, poly(4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid), PVBBA was synthesized via free-radical polymerization of 4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid (4-VBBA) and followed by modification with polyethylene glycol monomethy-lether (PEGME) with different molecular weights to produce boron containing comb-branched copolymers and abbreviated as PVBBAPEGMEX. Then copolymer electrolytes were successfully prepared by doping of the host matrix with CF3SO3Li at several stoichiometric ratios to get PVBBAPEGMEX-Y (X is the molecular weight of PEGME and Y is the EO/Li ratio). The materials were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR and B-11-NMR), thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The ionic conductivity of these novel copolymer electrolytes was studied by dielectric-impedance spectroscopy. Li-ion conductivity of these copolymer electrolytes depends on the length of the side units as well as the doping ratio. Such electrolytes possess satisfactory ambient temperature ionic conductivity (exceeding 10(-4) S/cm) and good mechanical strength. At higher doping ratios, Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) behavior of conductivity implies the coupling of the charge carriers with the segmental motion of the polymer chains. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries comprise solvent mixtures, but analysis of ion transport is always based on treating the solvents as a single-entity. We combine electrophoretic NMR (eNMR) measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify electric-field-induced transport in a concentrated solution containing LiPF6 salt dissolved in an ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/EMC) mixture. The selective transport of EC relative to EMC is reflected in the difference between two transference numbers, defined as the fraction of current carried by cations relative to the velocity of each solvent species. This difference arises from the preferential solvation of cations by EC and its dynamic consequences. The simulations reveal the presence of a large variety of transient solvent-containing clusters which migrate at different velocities. Rigorous averaging over different solvation environments is essential for comparing simulated and measured transference numbers. Our study emphasizes the necessity of acknowledging the presence of four species in mixed-solvent electrolytes.",9

"We report here the synthesis, characterization and properties of 3,6-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethylbenzenesulfonic acid (DHDMBS) as a new positive side electrolyte material for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (ORBAT). We have synthesized this material in pure form in high yield and confirmed its structure. We have determined that the standard reduction potential, the rate constant of the redox reaction, and the diffusion coefficient are ideally suited for use in ORBAT. Specifically, DHDMBS overcomes the major issue of Michael reaction with water faced with 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (BQDS) and similar unsubstituted benzoquinones in the selection of positive electrolyte materials. DHDMBS can be synthesized relatively inexpensively. We have demonstrated the chemical stability of DHDMBS to repeated electrochemical cycling through NMR and electrochemical studies proving the absence of products of the Michael reaction. A flow cell with DHDMBS and anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid has now been shown to operate close to 100% coulombic efficiency for over 25 cycles when continuously cycled at 100 mA/cm(2), and can sustain current densities as high as 500 mA/cm(2) without noticeable chemical degradation. However, there was a slow decrease in the capacity of the flow cell attributable to the crossover of DHDMBS from the positive side of the cell. Thus, the present study has shown DHDMBS as a promising candidate for the positive side material for an all-organic aqueous redox flow battery in acidic media, and our future efforts will focus on understanding the crossover of DHDMBS and the effects of long-term cycling.

"To this end, flexible MABs with sandwich-type, cable-type, and bamboo slip-type structures have been proposed. 1 Moreover, light and thin metal anodes (single-metal and metal-alloy anodes with different shapes, free-standing metal composite electrodes, etc.) can meet the flexibility requirements such as bending, deformation, and twisting. [...]flexible air cathodes and/or electrolytes with high performance and long-term stability have recently become the research focus of flexible MABs. 2 Compared with flexible all-solid-state LIBs with closed systems, flexible MABs possess a unique semi-open system, which provides a reaction platform for the cathode active materials (oxygen from ambient air or pure oxygen). [...]to the full contact between the liquid electrolyte and electrodes, the solid electrolyte and electrodes are in point contact.

"Aqueous metal–air batteries are promising next-generation energy storage and supply technologies due to their advantages of high energy density and intrinsic safety. As an abundant natural resource, applying seawater-based electrolytes is proposed to have considerable economic and environmental benefits, and will significantly broaden the applications of metal–air batteries. However, the existence of complex components in seawater, in particular chloride ions, inevitably has a complex influence on air electrode processes, including the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), requiring the development of efficient chloride-resistant electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, a few seawater-based metal–air battery prototypes have shown great application potential but are still at an early stage of development. In this review, we first propose the concept of seawater-based metal–air batteries and comprehensively analyze the essential air electrode reactions in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. Subsequently, rational design strategies for ORR and OER electrocatalysts suitable for use in chloride-containing and seawater-based electrolytes are comprehensively discussed. Moreover, the development history and potential applications of seawater-based metal–air batteries are demonstrated. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for future innovations.",16

"The challenges of energy depletion and environmental pollution raise the demands for the development of new energy technologies, such as metal-air batteries (MABs). The performance of a metal-air battery heavily relies on two fundamental electrocatalytic reactions, that is, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which take place at the air cathode during battery discharging and charging, respectively. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives stand out as promising candidate catalysts for the once sluggish redox reactions at the cathodes of MABs, due to their unique merits of crystalline porous structures and tunable chemistry. These distinct characteristics of MOFs offer an effective way to introduce bifunctionality (catalytic activity for ORR and OER in the case of MABs) through the design and synthesis of MOF-based catalysts with large surface area, well-developed porous networks, smooth electron and mass transfer pathways and active sites with different catalytic preferences. Herein, this review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of MOF-based catalysts for a range of MABs, including Li-, Zn-, Al-, Fe- and Na-air batteries. By the demonstration of representative examples, this review also discusses the underlying mechanisms for the origin of bifunctional performance and enhanced catalytic activity with MOF-based catalysts. Future challenges and prospects for both MOFs and MABs are also proposed at the end of this review.",16
"To stabilize bromine produced during a vanadium-bromine redox flow batteries (V-Br RFBs) charging, a bromine complexing agent (BCA) should be effectively used as a supporting material in V-Br electrolyte. However, there remains a problem of improving the unstable reversibility between V2+ and V3+ in electrolyte including halogen elements (Br and Cl). This paper describes two imidazole-based BCAs, which are 1,2-dimethyl-3-ethylimidazolium bromide (DMEIm: C7H13BrN2) and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (DMPIm: C8H15BrN2), for not only confirming the capture of bromine but also improving the redox reaction of vanadium ions in V-Br electrolyte. The effectiveness of the proposed two imidazole-based BCAs is demonstrated through the following experiments: cyclic voltammetry (CV), nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and cyclic cell operation test. Experimental results show that both the diffusion coefficient and the peak currents of each electrolyte using the proposed imidazole-based BCAs increases linearly with the rise of scan rate on the recorded CV curves, providing improved reversible reaction of V2+/V3+ in negative electrolyte. It also exhibits that the electrolytes using the DMEIm and DMPIm provide significantly improved charge (discharge) capacities which are 9.38 (31.01) % and 11.8 (35.66) % higher than the pristine one, respectively, resulting in 13.27% and 14.36% higher current efficiencies. In addition, corrosion cracks on the separator surface due to bromine attack are not observed after the cyclic cell operation. Consequently, these results indicate that the proposed two imidazole-based BCAs can not only sequester bromine during the V-Br RFB charging, but also enhance electrochemical reversibility caused by improving diffusion coefficient of vanadium.

The supramolecular lithium-ion conductor utilizes UPy and PEG functionalized CeO2 in the polymer matrix containing UPy units. The prepared electrolyte membranes form a supramolecular network with the UPy polymer on CeO2 via the quadruple hydrogen bonding. The supramolecular interactions were confirmed by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy.

"Perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) are polymer electrolytes with fluorinated carbon backbones that have high flash points and have been shown to exhibit moderate conductivities and high cation transference numbers when mixed with lithium salts. Ion transport in four PFPE electrolytes with different endgroups was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ac impedance, and pulsed-field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) as a function of salt concentration and temperature. In spite of the chemical similarity of the electrolytes, salt diffusion coefficients measured by PFG-NMR and the glass transition temperature measured by DSC appear to be uncorrelated to ionic conductivity measured by ac impedance. We calculate a non-dimensional parameter, beta, that depends on the salt diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivity. We also use the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher relationship to fit the temperature dependence of conductivity. We present a linear relationship between the prefactor in the VTF fit and beta, both parameters vary by four orders of magnitude in our experimental window. Our analysis suggests that transport in electrolytes with low dielectric constants (low beta) is dictated by ion hopping between clusters.",1

Activation energy values were determined from the conductivity data are decreased with increasing ionic conductivity. The transference number measurement was performed to characterize the polymer electrolyte for battery applications. Transference number values show that the charge transport in this electrolyte is predominantly due to the ions (t(ion) = 0.98).

"Polymer electrolytes with high Lit-ion conductivity provide a route toward improved safety and performance of Li+-ion batteries. However, most polymer electrolytes suffer from low ionic conduction and an even lower Li+-ion contribution to the conductivity (the transport number, t(+)), with the anion typically transporting over 80% of the charge. Here, we show that subtle and potentially undetected associations within a polymer electrolyte can entrain both the anion and the cation. When removed, the conductivity performance of the electrolyte can be improved by almost 2 orders of magnitude. Importantly, while some of this improvement can be attributed to a decreased glass transition temperature, T-g, the removal of the amide functional group reduces interactions between the polymer and the Li+ cations, doubling the Li+ t(+) to 0.43, as measured using pulsed-field-gradient NMR. This work highlights the importance of strategic synthetic design and emphasizes the dual role of T-g and ion binding for the development of polymer electrolytes with increased total ionic conductivity and the Lit ion contribution to it.",0

"Batteries based on zinc (Zn) chemistry offer a great opportunity for large-scale applications owing to their safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, the poor Zn reversibility and inhomogeneous electrodeposition have greatly impeded their practical implementation, stemming from water-related passivation/corrosion. Here, we present a multifunctional electrolyte comprising gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and Zn(BF4)(2)xH(2)O to resolve these intrinsic challenges. The systematic results confirm that water reactivity toward a Zn anode is minimized by forcing GBL solvents into the Zn2+ solvation shell and constructing a fluorinated interphase on the Zn anode surface via anion decomposition. Furthermore, NMR was selected as an auxiliary testing protocol to elevate and understand the role of electrolyte composition in building the interphase. The combined factors in synergy guarantee high Zn reversibility (average Coulombic efficiency is 99.74%), high areal capacity (55 mAh/cm(2)), and high Zn utilization (similar to 91%). Ultimately, these merits enable the Zn battery utilizing a VO2 cathode to operate smoothly over 5000 cycles with a low-capacity decay rate of similar to 0.0083% per cycle and a 0.23 Ah VO2/Zn pouch cell to operate over 400 cycles with a capacity retention of 77.3%.",9
"The anode solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode of lithium ion batteries contains lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium methyl carbonate (LMC), and lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC). The development of a strong physical understanding of the properties of the SEI requires a strong understanding of the evolution of the SEI composition over extended timeframes. The thermal stability of Li2CO3, LMC, and LEDC in the presence of LiPF6 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), a common salt and solvent, respectively, in lithium ion battery electrolytes, has been investigated to afford a better understanding of the evolution of the SEI.

The thermal decomposition of Li2CO3 and LiPF6 in DMC yields CO2, LiF, and F2PO2Li.

"We demonstrate that lithium metal is sparingly soluble in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Li-7 NMR shows that when a PEO sample is placed in contact with lithium metal at elevated temperatures, a lithium species dissolves and diffuses into the bulk polymer. A lithium/PEO/lithium electrochemical cell, containing no lithium salts, shows increasing conductivity over time when annealed at 120 degrees C. Chronoamperometry shows that the annealed cell obeys Ohm's law, implying that conduction occurs without the development of concentration gradients. To explain the results, it is proposed that atomic lithium dissolves into PEO, where it exists as a lithium cation and free electron. The dissolution of lithium also affects the phase behavior of block copolymer electrolytes. These observations explain the strong adhesion between lithium metal and PEO and have important implications for lithium metal battery systems that contain PEO-based electrolytes.",8
"Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) based on polyacrylonitrile elastomer (HNBR) are investigated for lithium-ion batteries application. This study examines the acrylonitrile content, as well as the solvent used to make the GPE, to understand their impact on lithium solvation. To do so, we propose a three-component system comprising HNBR:solvent:LiTFSI to pinpoint the correct ratio to provide the GPE with competitive conductivity. Infrared spectroscopy is used to shed light on the interactions between nitriles and lithium ions. Spin-lattice relaxation times (T-1) and diffusion coefficients of Li-7 and F-19 for various HNBR-based GPEs are obtained through PFG-NMR, enabling determination of the transport number of lithium cations (t(+)) and activation energy (E-a).

When this tested in Li5Ti4O12/LiFePO4 coin cells, a capacity of 135 mAh/g was obtained at a discharge rate of D/5, showing promising results for its use in Li-ion batteries. This study highlights the benefits of high acrylonitrile content in the polymer and a solvent with a moderate donor number to promote interactions between nitriles and Li+.",1
"The stability of electrolyte solutions during lithium-oxygen cells operation is of great importance and interest. This is because oxides formed during reduction are strong nucleophiles which can initiate solvent decomposition. The highly polar amide based solvents have come to the fore as possible candidates for Li-O-2 applications. They show typical cycling behavior as compared to other solvents; however, their stability toward lithium oxides is shrouded in doubt. The present study has focused on Li-O-2 cells containing electrolyte solutions based on DMA/LiNO3. We have used various analytical tools, to explore the discharge-charge processes and related side reactions. The data obtained from FTIR, NMR, XPS, and EQCM all support a rational decomposition mechanism. The formation of various side products during the course the first discharge, leads to the conclusion that amide based solvents are not suitable for Li-O-2 applications; however, electrolyte solution decomposition reduces the OER overpotential by forming oxidation mediators.",8
"Recently, lithium-ion batteries have been attracting more interest for use in automotive applications. Lithium resources are confirmed to be unevenly distributed in South America, and the cost of the lithium raw materials has roughly doubled from the first practical application in 1991 to the present and is increasing due to global demand for lithium-ion accumulators. Since the electrochemical equivalent and standard potential of sodium are the most advantageous after lithium, sodium based energy storage is of great interest to realize lithium-free high energy and high voltage batteries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no successful reports on electrochemical sodium insertion materials for battery applications; the major challenge is the negative electrode and its passivation. In this study, we achieve high capacity and excellent reversibility sodium-insertion performance of hard-carbon and layered NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrodes in propylene carbonate electrolyte solutions.

"Current flowing through an electrolyte is accompanied by continuum motion of ions and solvent, species concentration profiles, and the electric field. While, historically, the understanding of electrolyte transport has predominantly relied on interpreting macroscopic voltage (or current) measurements, recent advances in imaging and spectroscopic techniques allow velocity and concentration profiles to be probed directly. Such detailed information creates exciting opportunities-ranging from verifying theories describing transport in previously studied Li-ion electrolytes, to new approaches for measuring properties as well as accurately and precisely quantifying transport in more complex electrolytes. Such emerging directions are herein discussed.",0
"Fundamental understanding of the reactivity between electrode and electrolyte is key to design the safety and life of Li-ion batteries. Herein X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to examine the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) on carbon-free, binder-free LiCoO2 powder and thin-film electrodes in LP57 electrolyte as function of potential. Upon charging of LiCoO2 a marked growth of oxygenated and carbonated species was observed on the surface, consistent with electrolyte oxidation at high potentials. We also demonstrated that LiCoO2 oxide surface was prone to decompose the salt starting at 4.1 V-Li, as evidenced by the increase of LiF and LixPFyOz species upon charging. By DFT calculations we proposed a correlation between the interface composition and the thermodynamic tendency of the EC solvent for dissociative adsorption on the LixCoO2 surface, through the generation of reactive acidic OH groups on the oxide surface, which can have a role in the observed salt decomposition. This is consistent with the evidence of HF and PF2O2- species at 4.6 V-Li observed by solution F-19-NMR measurements. Finally we compared EEI composition between composite and model electrodes and discussed the changes and mechanisms induced by the electrode composition or the use of electrolyte additives. We showed that the addition of diphenyl carbonate (DPC) in the electrolyte has a strong impact on the formation of solvent and salt decomposition products at the EEI layer.

"The safety issues of lithium-ion batteries require the substitution of volatile and flammable organic components of the electrolyte. In this context, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) represent an interesting alternative to conventional ionic liquids as green solvents to dissolve common lithium salts. This paper explores two eutectics: i) ethylene glycol/choline chloride (EG/ChCl, 3:1 mol/mol), and ii) L-(+)-lactic acid/choline chloride (LA/ChCl, 2:1 mol/mol). The lithium salts added in both cases were LiN(CF3SO2)(2) and LiPF6, both in concentration of either 0.5 M or 1 M. They still retain their liquid properties despite the addition of relatively high molar contents (up to 1.0 M) of lithium salts. The 0.5 M LiFF6/EG:ChCl electrolyte, in particular, displays ionic conductivity of 7.95 mS cm(-1) at room temperature, and is thus very promising as a green and cheap electrolyte.",0

"In this article the spectroscopic studies basing on H-1, C-13, Al-27 NMR combined with FT-IR and Raman investigations are applied to the methylalumoxane (MAO)-oligoethhyleneglycol (PEG-ME) reaction leading to the formation of the inorganic-organic heterocomposite polymeric electrolyte. This process is analyzed in terms of the stoichiometry, chemical reaction observed and Al coordination properties changes. As the studied system is extremely complicated some model reaction systems basing on MAO and CH3OH, AlMe3 and PEG-ME, AlMe3 and CH3OH and finally Al(i-Pr)(3) and PEG-ME were also tested for comparison. A coordination change is observed for all alkiloaluminum compounds upon reaction progress starting from n = 4 to n = 6. Contrary. the reaction basing on the alcoxyaluminum compound does not reveal this phenomenon as the initial coordination number for aluminum is equal to six. Additionally, the optimal MAO to PEG-ME ratio was proved to be equal to six. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",8
"An effective electrolyte additive, 3-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyoxy) phenylboronic acid (TBPB), is proposed to significantly improve the cycle stability of high voltage LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode. Experimental and computational results show that TBPB has a relatively higher oxidation activity than base electrolyte, and preferentially constructs a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) containing B -/Si-components on LCO surface. Theoretical calculation, XPS and NMR data show that TBPB-derived CEI layer contains B-F species and has the function of eliminating HF. The as-formed CEI effectively inhibits the detrimental side reactions from electrolyte decomposition and LCO surface structure reconstruction. The capacity retention of LCO/Li half-cell increases from 38.92% (base electrolyte) to 83.70% after 150 cycles at 1 C between 3.0 V and 4.5 V by adding 1% TBPB. Moreover, TBPB is also reduced prior to base electrolyte, forming an ionic conducting solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite surface. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between CEI layer on LCO cathode and SEI layer on graphite anode to effectively decrease the electrolyte",16
"Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries have long been considered a potentially more sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries because of their better environmental compatibility, enhanced safety and cost advantage. However, in the presence of an aqueous electrolyte, the Zn anode is poised to undergo dendrite failure, corrosion and hydrogen evolution, all of which resonate with each other leading to fast performance degradation. Here, in a break from the current aqueous battery path, we report a low-cost hydrous organic electrolyte involving a hydrated Zn(BF4)2 salt and an ethylene glycol solvent, which not only promotes the in situ formation of a favourable ZnF2 passivation layer to protect Zn from dendrite growth and side reactions but also embraces excellent non-flammability. Remarkably, the present Zn anode sustains a long-term cycling over 4,000 h at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% and shows an areal capacity as high as 5 mAh cm−2. Equally intriguingly, the electrolyte can run across a wide temperature range from −30 °C to 40 °C without seriously compromising performance. The Zn//V2O5 full cells with our electrolyte also perform much better in terms of capacity retention than a device with an aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. Our findings suggest a promising direction for developing electrolyte solutions for practical Zn batteries which combine safety, performance and sustainability.",12
"Rechargeable aqueous zinc-based batteries (ZBBs) are attracting more and more attention for portable electronic equipment and large-scale energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. However, further applications of ZBBs still face many challenges, including the issues of side reactions (hydrogen evolution, corrosion, and passivation) and zinc dendrite formation at the anode. Thus, a rational anode design is critical for high-performance ZBBs. In this review, we will first provide a fundamental understanding of the side reaction and dendrite issues at the anode, and then summarize the progress on mitigation strategies to suppress these unwanted electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the relevant mechanisms of various strategies will be illustrated in-depth. Therefore, this perspective will provide a thorough and deep guidance to construct high-performance and dendrite-free ZBBs.",12
"Flexible Zn-based batteries are regarded as promising alternatives to flexible lithium-ion batteries for wearable electronics owing to the natural advantages of zinc, such as environmental friendliness and low cost.

"Magnesium batteries are an energy storage system that potentially offers high energy density, but development of new high voltage cathode materials and understanding of their electrochemical mechanism are critical to realize its benefits. Herein, we synthesize the layered MnO2 polymorph (the birnessite phase) as a nanostructured phase supported on conductive carbon cloth and compare its electrochemistry and structural changes when it is cycled as a positive electrode material in a Mg-ion battery under nonaqueous or aqueous conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies show that a conversion mechanism takes place during cycling in a nonaqueous electrolyte, with the formation of MnOOH, MnO, and Mg(OH)2 upon discharge. In aqueous cells, on the other hand, intercalation of Mg2+ ions takes place, accompanied by expulsion of interlayer water and transformation to a spinel-like phase as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. Both systems are structurally quasireversible. The sharp contrast in behavior in the two electrolytes points to the important role of the desolvation energy of the Mg2+ cation in nonaqueous systems.",11
"Rechargeable Mg batteries, using high capacity and dendrite-free Mg metal anodes, are promising energy storage devices for large scale smart grid due to low cost and high safety. However, the performance of Mg batteries is still plagued by the slow reaction kinetics of their cathode materials. Recent discoveries demonstrate that water in cathode can significantly enhance the Mg-ion diffusion in cathode by an unknown mechanism. Here, we propose the water-activated layered-structure VOPO4 as a novel cathode material and examine the impact of water in electrode or organic electrolyte on the thermodynamics and kinetics of Mg-ion intercalation/deintercalation in cathodes. Electrochemical measurements verify that water in both VOPO4 lattice and organic electrolyte can largely activate VOPO4 cathode. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the water in the electrolyte will equilibrate with the structural water in VOPO4 lattice, and the water activity in the electrolyte alerts the mechanism and kinetics for electrochemical Mg-ion intercalation in VOPO4. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that water reduces both the solid-state diffusion barrier in the VOPO4 electrode and the desolvation penalty at the interface. To achieve fast reaction kinetics, the water activity in the electrolyte should be larger than 10–2. The proposed activation mechanism provides guidance for screening and designing novel chemistry for high performance multivalent-ion batteries.",11
"Rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries are a promising candidate technology to address future electrical energy storage needs of large scale mobile and stationary devices, due to the high environmental abundance of magnesium metal and divalent character of magnesium ion. With the recent increase in reports discussing cathode materials for magnesium-ion batteries, it is instructive to assess recent research in order to provide inspiration for future research. This review is a summary of the different chemistries and structures of the materials developed for magnesium ion cathodes. The particular strategies which may lead to future research initiatives are amplified.",11
"With the development of electric vehicles and smart grid systems, safety and cost of power sources are becoming increasingly important, and in this regard, magnesium batteries have been considered as a promising power source because they are safer and less expensive than commercialized lithium-ion batteries. (1−5) In particular, the absence of dendrite formation on the Mg metal anode is one of the most attractive aspects of magnesium batteries, leading to their excellent safety. (6,7) However, there are still challenges for realizing practical magnesium batteries. One challenge is the difficulty of utilizing Mg metal as an anode with various electrolytes. Mg metal cannot be used with the conventional carbonate-based solvents used for commercialized lithium-ion batteries, because when Mg metal is in contact with those solvents, a thick passivation layer forms on the surface of Mg metal, leading to failures in the stripping and plating of magnesium. (8,9) The stripping and plating of magnesium metal is only reversible in a few electrolytes such as organohaloaluminate salt in tetrahydrofuran (THF), (1) magnesium aluminum chloro complex in THF, (10) and ether-based electrolytes containing magnesium salt and chloride additives. (11,12) Moreover, organohaloaluminate salts are acidic, leading to corrosive reaction. (13,14) In order to overcome these limitations, Mg2+ insertion materials have been considered as alternatives to Mg metal, because they exhibit reversible insertion and deinsertion of Mg2+ with conventional electrolytes. For example, Mg2+ ions are reversibly inserted into Bi and Sn. (15,16) However, although those alloy materials exhibited the reversible insertion of Mg2+, they suffered drawbacks such as pulverization due to a large volume change during cycling, resulting in poor cycle performance. Therefore, in this study, we introduce graphite as a host material for the intercalation of Mg2+ ions. Unlike the alloying reaction mechanism of alloy materials such as Bi and Sn, graphite stores Mg2+ ions through an intercalation reaction mechanism, leading to no pulverization. Moreover, the Mg2+ ions are reversibly cointercalated into graphite with linear ether solvents, leading to promising electrochemical performance.",11
"Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries have been attracting increasing attention recently because of the abundance of the raw material, their relatively low price and their good safety characteristics. However, rechargeable Mg batteries are still in their infancy. Therefore, alternate Mg-ion insertion anode materials are highly desirable to ultimately mass-produce rechargeable Mg batteries. In this study, we introduce the spinel Li4Ti5O12 as an Mg-ion insertion-type anode material with a high reversible capacity of 175 mA h g−1. This material possesses a low-strain characteristic, resulting in an excellent long-term cycle life. The proposed Mg-storage mechanism, including phase separation and transition reaction, is evaluated using advanced atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. This unusual Mg storage mechanism has rarely been reported for ion insertion-type electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. Our findings offer more options for the development of Mg-ion insertion materials for long-life rechargeable Mg batteries.",11
"The increasing interest in future energy storage technologies has generated the urgent need for alternative rechargeable magnesium ion batteries due to their innate merits in terms of raw abundance, theoretical capacity, and operational safety. Herein, we report an alternative pathway to a new energy storage regime: toward advanced rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries based on WSe2 nanowire-assembled film cathodes. The as-grown electrodes delivered efficient Mg2+ intercalation/insertion activity, excellent cycling life, enhanced specific capacity, and excellent rate capability. We also evaluated the influence of Mg-intercalation behavior on Mg-ion batteries based on WSe2 film cathodes via the first-principles DFT computations. The results reveal the feasibility of using advanced magnesium-ion batteries based on WSe2 film as energy storage components in next-generation optoelectronic systems.",11
"The lack of electrolytes that simultaneously possess high Coulombic efficiency, conductivity, and voltage stability has hindered the deployment of rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries. With few exceptions, the tenacious oxide layer on magnesium metal has limited the scope of research to halide ion-based electrolytes, which help activate the electrode surface but also limit the working voltage window considerably. Herein, we demonstrate a new class of magnesium electrolytes based on fluoroalkoxyaluminate anions synthesized via a facile and scalable method and its incorporation in a full battery cell. Mixtures of magnesium and aluminum fluoroalkoxides in ethereal solvents result in solutions that can reversibly deposit magnesium metal with near unit efficiency in addition to achieving suitable oxidative stabilities (>3.5 V vs Mg/Mg2+ on glassy carbon and gold) and conductivities (>6 mS cm–1).",11
"Rechargeable magnesium batteries are identified as a promising next-generation energy storage system, but their development is hindered by the anode−electrolyte−cathode incompatibilities and passivation of magnesium metal anode. To avoid or alleviate these problems, the exploitation of alternative anode materials is a promising choice. Herein, we present titanium pyrophosphate (TiP2O7) as anode materials for magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) and investigate the effect of the crystal phase on its magnesium storage performance. Compared with the metastable layered TiP2O7, the thermodynamically stable cubic TiP2O7 displays a better rate capability of 72 mAh g−1 at 5000 mA g−1. Moreover, cubic TiP2O7 exhibits excellent cycling stability with the capacity of 60 mAh g−1 after 5000 cycles at 1000 mA g−1, which are better than previously reported Ti-based anode materials for MIBs. In situ X-ray diffraction technology confirms the single-phase magnesium-ion intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism of cubic TiP2O7 with a low volume change of 3.2%. In addition, the density functional theory calculation results demonstrate that three-dimensional magnesium-ion diffusion can be allowed in cubic TiP2O7 with a low migration energy barrier of 0.62 eV. Our work demonstrates the promise of TiP2O7 as high-rate and long-life anode materials for MIBs and may pave the way for further development of MIBs.",11
"This paper describes the design and synthesis of a series of terpyridine-based complexes of the first-row transition metals Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co for non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NARFBs). Electrochemical studies reveal that these complexes can undergo multi-electron transfer redox reactions. In particular, the Mn and Fe-based com-plexes exhibit both low negative redox potentials and high positive redox potential, permitting them to serve as a bipolar electrolyte for symmetric RFBs with a cell voltage of more than 2 V. The solubility of these complexes can be effectively improved by incorporating a polyether substituent on the terpyridine ligand and counter anion optimization. The iron complex [Fe(tpy-O(CH2CH2O)3CH3)2][TFSI]2 shows a high solubility of 0.76 M in MeCN. The fabricated iron-based symmetric NARFB demonstrates a superior battery performance with a high cell voltage of 2.3 V, columbic efficiency of 97%, energy efficiency as high as 88%, and stable charge-discharge capacity retention of 60% after 160 cycles, corresponding to 99.75 % capacity retention per cycle. The post-cycling cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV-Vis, and 1H-NMR characterizations indicate only minor chemical decom-position of the cycled complex, confirming its good charging-discharging stability.",16
"The combination of a magnesium anode with a sulfur cathode is one of the most promising electrochemical couples because of its advantages of good safety, low cost, and a high theoretical energy density. However, magnesium sulfur batteries are still in a very early stage of research and development, and the discovery of suitable electrolytes is the key challenge for further improvement. Here, a new preparation method for non-nucleophilic electrolyte solutions using a two-step reaction in one-pot is presented, which provides a feasible way to optimize the physiochemical properties of the electrolyte for the application in magnesium sulfur batteries. The first use of modified electrolytes in glymes and binary solvents of glyme and ionic liquid shows beneficial effects on the performance of magnesium sulfur batteries. New insights into the reaction mechanism of electrochemical conversion between magnesium and sulfur are also investigated.",14
"The present study shows the electrochemical performance of a room-temperature magnesium/sulfur (Mg/S) battery with a newly designed sulfur (3–0.5 mgsulfur cm−2) composite cathode. Operando Raman spectroscopy is employed to investigate the formation of polysulfide species at the cathode of Mg/S cells during the charge/discharge process, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to correlate the Raman modes with a series of polysulfide species (Sxn−, x = 1–8). Operando Raman spectroscopy proves the chemical transformation from elemental sulfur (S8) via long and short chain polysulfides to magnesium sulfide upon discharge and conversion back to elemental sulfur during charging. Furthermore, the spectral measurements indicate the formation of a nanocrystalline magnesium sulfide with a cubic zinc blende phase at the end of discharge. The changes in the open circuit potential of the Mg/S cell during the resting period are investigated with the help of various spectroscopic techniques. These studies conclude that cell impedance is dominated by the anode side impedance due to the formation of a passivation layer under static conditions. Finally, the impedance studies under dynamic conditions verify that the applied electrode potential plays a significant role on the evolution of the anode interfacial impedance.",14
"The emerging energy-storage technologies must meet the requirement of low cost, reasonable safety, high natural abundance, and high energy density. The rechargeable magnesium-sulfur battery (Mg-S) meets these requirements as a new and emerging technology because of its high specific energy (1722 Wh. kg−1) and dendrite free plating/stripping of magnesium anode. However, its performance is restrained by the sluggish magnesium ion diffusions and unavailability of high-voltage magnesium electrolytes compatible with sulfur cathodes. As a result, Mg-S batteries suffer from poor reversible capacity and cycle life. Furthermore, the formation of magnesium polysulfide (Mg-PS) is considered as a biggest R&D challenge for Mg-S batteries. To alleviate these problems, numerous breakthroughs and achievements have been made in the past five years. This review covers the research and development to date on Mg-S systems including working mechanism, development of nucleophilic and non-nucleophilic electrolytes, inorganic electrolyte additives, fabrications of sulfur cathodes, effect of binders, polysulfide confinement via cathode or separator treatments, and in-situ characterizations of electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The electrochemical properties of newly developed Mg-S systems are debated in terms of cell configuration, composition of electrolyte, specific capacity, cycle performance, over potential and working voltages. Furthermore, the current challenges and possible research gaps in Mg-S systems are critically discussed along with future perspectives. We hope this review will revolutionize the deep understanding of Mg-S battery and open the new horizons to develop the highly efficient cathodes and electrolytes in near future.",14
"Aluminum-sulfur (Al−S) chemistry is attractive for the development of next-generation rechargeable battery systems. However, only a few reversible Al−S cells have been reported until now. This paper demonstrates that the use of an AlCl3/urea electrolyte in Al−S cells is a promising approach to improve the cycle life and reach a high discharge voltage plateau of ∼1.6–2.0 V. In contrast to the instability of sulfur in the conventional AlCl3/EMIC electrolyte, sulfur is chemically stable in the AlCl3/urea electrolyte, which allows better cell cycling stability. The Al−S cell delivers an initial capacity of ∼700 mAh gs−1 and maintains a capacity of up to ∼500 mAh gs−1 after 100 cycles.",7
"An aluminum–sulfur battery comprised of a composite sulfur cathode, aluminum anode and an ionic liquid electrolyte of AlCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride is described. The electrochemical reduction of elemental sulfur has been studied in different molar ratios of the electrolyte, and aluminum tetrachloride ions have been identified at the electroactive ionic species. The Al/S battery exhibits a discharge voltage plateau of 1.1–1.2 V, with extremely high charge storage capacity of more than 1500 mAh g−1, relative to the mass of sulfur in the cathode. The energy density of the Al/S cell is estimated to be 1700 Wh kg−1 sulfur, which is competitive with the most attractive battery chemistries targeted for high-energy electrochemical storage. Characterization by means of SEM, XRD and XPS of the battery components reveal complete dissolution of sulfur-based discharge products to the electrolyte. The low cost, natural abundance and high volumetric energy density of both anode and cathode materials define a research path for new materials and cell designs for next-generation Al/S battery systems.",7
"The addition of 2% vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC) into LiPF6/EC + DMC electrolyte can significantly improve the cyclic performance of a LiNi0.8Co0.2O2/Li cell at elevated temperatures such as 50 degrees C. In situ electrochemical mass spectrometry (EMS) was used to investigate the gas evolution spectroscopy in the cell during a charge/discharge process with and without VEC additive. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), and liquid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies were also carried out to investigate the reactions between various electrolyte components and VEC without the electrochemical reaction. We propose the possible polymerized products based on the spectroscopy and the acting mechanism of the VEC additives.",16
"Lithium metal has the highest volumetric and gravimetric energy density of all negative-electrode materials when used as an electrode material in a lithium rechargeable battery. However, the formation of lithium dendrites and/or 'moss' on the metal electrode surface can lead to short circuits following several electrochemical charge-discharge cycles, particularly at high rates, rendering this class of batteries potentially unsafe and unusable owing to the risk of fire and explosion. Many recent investigations have focused on the development of methods to prevent moss/dendrite formation. In parallel, it is important to quantify Li-moss formation, to identify the conditions under which it forms. Although optical and electron microscopy can visually monitor the morphology of the lithium-electrode surface and hence the moss formation, such methods are not well suited for quantitative studies. Here we report the use of in situ NMR spectroscopy, to provide time-resolved, quantitative information about the nature of the metallic lithium deposited on lithium-metal electrodes.",9
"FeF3 has attracted considerable attention as a positive electrode material for next-generation rechargeable lithium ion batteries, because of its low cost, low risk, and high energy density, which facilitate a conversion-type lithiation/delithiation reaction. However, the conversion reaction of the FeF3 electrode is known to suffer from capacity fading during repeated discharge-charge cycles. Herein, we find an interesting correlation between capacity fading behavior and spectral evolutions in electrochemical operando nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The operando Li-7 NMR spectra demonstrate the reversible formation of metallic Fe by the conversion process during the early discharge-charge cycles. However, it is gradually suppressed after repeated cycles. Moreover, LiF is augmented at the fully charged states, indicating that FeF3 is no longer recovered after repeated cycles. The active material can converge into FeF2 and LiF in the degraded electrode. Another factor associated with capacity degradation is the electrolyte decomposition occurring at high voltages, which results in a resistive film coating the electrode surface. We therefore conclude that the film accumulation on repeated discharging inhibits the conversion reaction to metallic Fe and LiF, leading to a characteristic capacity fading behavior of FeF3.",8
"There is increasing evidence that the solvation structure of the active components in a liquid electrolyte solution strongly impacts the performance in electrochemical applications. In this work, the nanoscale solvation structures and dynamics of Mg(BH4)(2) and Mg(TFSI)(2) dissolved in diglyme (DGM) at various concentrations and ratios of Mg(BH4)(2)/Mg(TFSI)(2) were investigated using a combination of natural abundance Mg-25 NMR, quantum chemistry calculations of Mg-25 NMR chemical shifts, classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, and electrochemical performance tests. By mixing two competing Mg salts, we were able to reduce the strong covalent interactions between Mg2+ and BH4- anions. A small increase is observed in the coordination number of Mg-TFSI and a significant increase in the interaction of Mg2+ ions with glymes. Through a combination of NMR, DFT and MD simulations, various stable species around 1 nm in size were detected in the mixed salt solution, which play key roles in the enhanced electrochemical performance of the mixed electrolyte. It is established that for the neat Mg(TFSI)(2) in DGM electrolyte at dilute concentrations the TFSI-is fully dissociated from Mg2+. At higher concentrations, Mg2+ and TFSI-are only partially dissociated as contact ion pairs are formed. In contrast, at 0.01M Mg(BH4)(2) (saturated concentration) in DGM, the first solvation shell of a Mg2+ ion contains two BH4- anions and one DGM molecule, while the second solvation shell consists of five to six DGM molecules. An exchange mechanism between the solvation structures in the combined electrolyte containing both Mg(BH4)(2) and Mg(TFSI)(2) in DGM was found to result in the observation of a single Mg-25 NMR peak. This exchange is responsible for an increase in uncoordinated anions, as well as improved stability and ionic conductivity as compared to single anion solution. Solvent molecule rearrangement and direct Mg-ion exchange between the basic solvation structures are hypothesized as likely reasons for the exchange. We elucidate that the solvent rearrangement is energetically much more favorable than direct Mg-ion hopping and is thus suggested as the dominant exchange mechanism.",0
"A series of novel branched copolyethers, poly((1,3-dioxIolane)-co-((2-(2-methoxylethoxyl)methyl)oxirane)) (P(DXL-co-MEMO)) and poly( (1,3-dioxIolane)-co-( (2-(2-(2-methoxylethoxyl)ethoxyl)methyl)oxirane)) (P(DXL-co-ME2MO)), were synthesized via cationic polymerization, and the structures of these copolymers were characterized by H-1 NMR and GPC. Ionic conductivities of copolyether/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide (LiTFSI), polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI and PEO/copolyether/LiTFSI were investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the ionic conductivity of the P(DXL-co-MEMO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte was higher than that of the P(DXL-co-ME2MO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte, and the room temperature ionic conductivity of the P(DXL-co-MEMO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte was up to 2.2 x 10(-4) S cm(-1). Compared with the PEO/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte, the ionic conductivities of the PEO/copolyether/LiTFSI composite polymer electrolytes had a great improvement, but their thermal stabilities did not obviously reduce.

"A copolymer P(MMA-AN-MALi) (PMAML) was synthesized by solution polymerization. It was then blended with PVDF for preparing porous membranes by solution casting, and the non-solvent or extraction step was unnecessary in this process. A novel gelled polymer electrolyte based on the blend of PMAML and PVDF was obtained by soaking the polymer membrane in organic liquid electrolytes. The composition of the copolymer was determined from its H-1-NMR spectrum, and the result showed that the molar ratio of MMA: AN: MALi was about 68.6: 21. 5 : 9. 9. The surface structure of the polymer film was characterized by SEM. The pores were well distributed in the surface of the membrane and the porous size was about 5 mum. The ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte was measured by the AC impedance method,and it was about 2.5 x 10(-3) S . cm(-1) at room temperature. The electrochemical stability window was carried out on the stainless steel electrode with lithium metal electrodes as the reference and counter electrodes by the linear sweep voltammetry method. The polymer electrolyte was electrochemically stable under 4.5 V.

"A composite of mesoporous silica (SBA-15) with a polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymer electrolyte is examined for use in various electrochemical devices. Incorporation of SBA-15 in a PEO:LiClO4 polymer electrolyte facilitates salt dissociation, enhances ion conductivity, and improves miscibility between organic and inorganic moieties. Optimized conductivity is found at 10 wt.% SBA-15 composition, above this concentration the conductivity is reduced due to aggregation of a SBA-15:Li rich phase. Heating above melt temperature of PEO allows more of the polymer segments to interact with SBA-15. This results in a greater degree of disorder upon cooling, and the ion conductivity is enhanced. A Li-7 MAS NMR study reveals three types of lithium-ion coordination. Two major types of conduction mechanism can be identified: one through conventional amorphous PEO; a second via hopping in a sequential manner by replacing the nearby vacancies ('holes') on the surface (both interior and exterior) of the SBA-15 channels.

Impurities from E2 elimination can easily be overlooked during the conventional method of ionic liquid preparation via S(N)2 substitution. Initial electrochemical examination of the synthesized ionic liquids shows good compatibility with Li-1.1 (Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)(0.9)O-2 cathode material. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,0
"The growth of lithium microstructures during battery cycling has, to date, prohibited the use of Li metal anodes and raises serious safety concerns even in conventional lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, particularly if they are charged at high rates. The electrochemical conditions under which these Li microstructures grow have, therefore, been investigated by in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and susceptibility calculations. Lithium metal symmetric bag cells containing LiPF6 in EC/DMC electrolytes were used. Distinct Li-7 NMR resonances were observed due to the Li metal bulk electrodes and microstructures, the changes in peak positions and intensities being monitored in situ during Li deposition. The changes in the NMR spectra, observed as a function of separator thickness and porosity (using Celgard and Whatmann glass microfiber membranes) and different applied pressures, were correlated with changes in the type of microstructure, by using SEM. Isotopically enriched Li-6 metal electrodes were used against natural abundance predominantly Li-7 metal counter electrodes to investigate radiofrequency (rf) field penetration into the Li anode and to confirm the assignment of the higher frequency peak to Li dendrites. The conclusions were supported by calculations performed to explore the effect of the different microstructures on peak position/broadening, the study showing that Li NMR spectroscopy can be used as a sensitive probe of both the amount and type of microstructure formation.",11
"Considerable work was carried out on metal/air batteries in the 1960's and early 1970's for a variety of applications. After this time, however, the overall effort was considerably reduced due to materials problems at the air electrode, thermal management, and miscellaneous technical problems associated with the various anodes evaluated. Recent advances in the performance and stability of air cathodes, together with new and improved candidate anodes, make a comparison of metal/air batteries appropriate at this time. This review concentrates on comparing lithium, aluminum, magnesium, zinc and iron/air batteries with particular emphasis on the suitability of each system for electric vehicle propulsion. The relative merits of mechanically and electrically rechargeable batteries are given, together with systems employing static and circulating electrolytes. We conclude that, due to the institutional difficulties associated with the deployment of recharge systems for mechanically rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles, electrically rechargeable systems are more viable for commercialization in the near term. This conclusion makes zinc/air and iron/air batteries major candidates for this application.",16
"Metal–air batteries are a promising technology that could be used in several applications, from portable devices to large-scale energy storage applications. This work is a comprehensive review of the recent progress made in metal-air batteries MABs. It covers the theoretical considerations and mechanisms of MABs, electrochemical performance, and the progress made in the development of different structures of MABs. The operational concepts and recent developments in MABs are thoroughly discussed, with a particular focus on innovative materials design and cell structures. The classical research on traditional MABs was chosen and contrasted with metal–air flow systems, demonstrating the merits associated with the latter in terms of achieving higher energy density and efficiency, along with stability. Furthermore, the recent applications of MABs were discussed. Finally, a broad overview of challenges/opportunities and potential directions for commercializing this technology is carefully discussed. The primary focus of this investigation is to present a concise summary and to establish future directions in the development of MABs from traditional static to advanced flow technologies. A systematic analysis of this subject from a material and chemistry standpoint is presented as well.",16
"Electrical energy storage and conversion is vital to a clean, sustainable, and secure energy future. Among all electrochemical energy storage devices, metal-air batteries have potential to offer the highest energy density, representing the most promising systems for portable (electronics), mobile (electrical vehicles), and stationary (micro-grids) applications. To date, however, many fundamental issues are yet to be overcome to realize this potential. For example, efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air-electrode are yet to be developed to significantly reduce the polarization loss in metal-air batteries, which severely hinders the rate capability, energy efficiency, and operational life. In this progress report, a brief overview is first presented of the critical issues relevant to air-electrodes in metal-air batteries. Some recent advancements in the development of non-precious catalysts for ORR in Li-air and Zn-air batteries are then highlighted, including transition metal oxides, low-dimensional carbon-based structures, and other catalysts such as transition-metal macrocycles and metal nitrides. New directions and future perspectives for metal-air batteries are also outlined.",16
"In the last few decades, there are some exciting developments in the field of lithium (Li)-ion batteries from small portable devices to large power system such as electric vehicles (EVs). However, the maximum energy density of lithium-ion batteries is insufficient for the extended range of EVs propulsion. On the other hand, metal-air batteries have a greater power storage capacity, a few times more than the best performing lithium-ion batteries. Mechanically rechargeable zinc (Zn)-, magnesium (Mg)-, and aluminum (Al)-air batteries are receiving increasing attention, due to the advantages of using safe, low cost and abundant materials. If successfully developed, these batteries could provide an energy source for EVs comparing that of gasoline in terms of usable energy density. Nevertheless, there are still numerous scientific and technical challenges that must be overcome, if this alluring promise can be turned into reality. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances and challenges of metal air batteries from various elements, including air cathode, electrolyte, and anode. In addition, this review outlines the fundamental principles and understanding of the electrochemical reactions in the areas of lithium-air batteries. Finally, a summary of future research directions in the field of the metal-air batteries is provided.",16
"The large-scale electrical energy storage using rechargeable batteries buoys any future success in the global efforts to shift energy usage away from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Compared with other battery technologies, such as Li-S and LIBs, the metal-air battery technology holds exceptionally high energy densities and is viewed to be a promising candidate as the energy supplier of the next generation. With the aim to provide easy access to the recent developments of metal-air batteries and advance their development, this review systematically and comprehensively summarizes, compares and discusses the development of all important kinds of aqueous and/or nonaqueous metal-air batteries (all in one), based on metal anodes of Li, Na, Zn, Al, from all important aspects, including oxygen electrochemistry, electrocatalyst, transfer/diffusion and interface, electrode and electrolyte materials, and device configuration. As a benefit, our understanding on metal-air batteries can be deepened and guidance for the development of next generation metal-air batteries can be provided.",16
"A high-performance all-inorganic magnesium-lithium chloride complex (MLCC) electrolyte is synthesized by a simple room-temperature reaction of LiCl with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. Molecular dynamics simulation, density functional theory calculation, Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that the formation of [MgxLiyCl2x+y center dot nTHF] complex solvation structure significantly lowers the coordination number of THF in the first solvation sheath of Mg2+, which significantly enhances its de-solvation kinetics. The MLCC electrolyte presents a stable electrochemical window up to 3.1 V (vs Mg/Mg2+) and enables reversible cycling of Mg metal deposition/stripping with an outstanding Coulombic efficiency up to 99% at current densities as high as 10 mA cm(-2). Utilizing the MLCC electrolyte, a Mg/Mo6S8 full cell can be cycled for over 10 000 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 85 mA h g(-1) under an ultrahigh rate of 50 C (1 C = 128.8 mA g(-1)). The facile synthesis of high-performance MLCC electrolyte provides a promising solution for future practical magnesium batteries.",9
"The mitigation of decomposition reactions of lithium-ion battery electrolyte solutions is of critical importance in controlling device lifetime and performance. However, due to the complexity of the system, exacerbated by the diverse set of electrolyte compositions, electrode materials, and operating parameters, a clear understanding of the key chemical mechanisms remains elusive. In this work, operando pressure measurements, solution NMR, and electrochemical methods were combined to study electrolyte oxidation and reduction at multiple cell voltages. Two-compartment LiCoO2/Li cells were cycled with a lithium-ion conducting glass-ceramic separator so that the species formed at each electrode could be identified separately and further reactions of these species at the opposite electrode prevented. One principal finding is that chemical oxidation (with an onset voltage of similar to 4.7 V vs Li/Li+ for LiCoO2), rather than electrochemical reaction, is the dominant decomposition process at the positive electrode surface in this system. This is ascribed to the well-known release of reactive oxygen at higher states-of-charge, indicating that reactions of the electrolyte at the positive electrode are intrinsically linked to surface reactivity of the active material. Soluble electrolyte decomposition products formed at both electrodes are characterized, and a detailed reaction scheme is constructed to rationalize the formation of the observed species. The insights on electrolyte decomposition through reactions with reactive oxygen species identified through this work have a direct impact on understanding and mitigating degradation in high-voltage/higher-energy-density LiCoO2-based cells, and more generally for cells containing nickel-containing cathode materials (e.g., LiNixMnyCOzO2; NMCs), as they lose oxygen at lower operating voltages.",16
"The understanding of the reaction mechanism and temporal speciation of the lithium sulfur batteries is challenged by complex polysulfide disproportionation chemistry coupled with the precipitation and dissolution of species. In this report, for the first time, we present a comprehensive method to investigate lithium sulfur electrochemistry using in situ 7Li NMR spectroscopy, a technique that is capable of quantitatively capturing the evolution of the soluble and precipitated lithium (poly)sulfides during electrochemical cycling. Through deconvolution and quantification, every lithium-bearing species was closely tracked and four-step soluble lithium polysulfide-mediated lithium sulfur electrochemistry was demonstrated in never before seen detail. Significant irreversible accumulation of Li2S is observed on the Li metal anode after four cycles because of sulfur shuttling. The application of the method presented here to study electrolyte/additive development and lithium protection research can be readily envisaged.",15
"In this study, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (PEGME) using borane-tetrahydrofuran (BH3/THF) complex. Molecular weights of both PVA and PEGME were varied prior to reaction. Boron containing comb-branched copolymers were produced and abbreviated as PVA1PEGMEX and PVA2PEGMEX. Then polymer electrolytes were successfully prepared by doping of the host matrix with CF3SO3Li at several stoichiomeric ratios with respect to EO to Li. The materials were characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR and B-11 NMR). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The ionic conductivity of these novel polymer electrolytes were studied by dielectric-impedance spectroscopy. Li-ion conductivity of these polymer electrolytes depends on the length of the side units as well as the doping ratio. Such electrolytes possess satisfactory ambient temperature ionic conductivity (>10(-4) Scm(-1)). Cyclic voltammetry results illustrated that the electrochemical stability domain extends over 4V.

"The conditions in which degradation processes at the positive electrode/electrolyte interface occur are still incompletely understood and traditional surface analytical techniques struggle to characterize and depict accurately interfacial films. In the present work, information on the growth and evolution of the interphases upon storage and cycling as well as their electrochemical consequences are gathered in the case of LiNi1/2Mn1/2O2 with commonly used LiPF6 (1 M in EC/DMC) electrolyte.The use of Li-7, F-19 and P-31 MAS NMR, made quantitative through the implementation of empirical calibration, is combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to probe the elements involved in surface species and to unravel the inhomogenous architecture of the interphase. At room temperature, contact with the electrolyte leads to a covering of the oxide surface first by LiF and lithiated organic species are found on the outer part of the interphase. At 55 degrees C, not only the interphase proceeds in further covering of the surface but also thickens resulting in an increase of 240% of lithiated species and the presence of -POF2 fluorophosphates. The composition gradient within the interphase depth is also strongly affected by the temperature.In agreement with the electrochemical performance. quantitative NMR surface analyses show that the use of LiBOB-modified electrolyte results in a Li-enriched interphase, intrinsically less resistive than the standard LiPF6-based interphase, comprised of a mixture of resistive LiF with non lithiated species.

"The electrochemical behaviour of octafluoro-9,10-anthroquinone is reported, motivated by the use of this lipophilic quinone as the negative electrode couple (anolyte) in redox flow battery applications. At low concentrations, the reduction mechanism is found to follow the classic EE process, expected for quinones in aprotic solution and both anionic species are stable on the voltammetric timescale. The reduction process is, however, strongly influenced by a number of factors, including the identity of the electrolyte cation. The dianion is also unstable on longer timescales, with a disproportionation mechanism affecting the stability of reduced products, even at potentials above the reduction potential of the mono-anion. An insoluble film is shown to form on the electrode surface, which gradually degrades the voltammetric response. Conclusions from the electrochemical data are supported by in situ EPR and ex situ NMR spectroscopy.",10
"Self-supported gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was prepared based on copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile-vinyl acetate) (P(MMA-AN-VAc)). The copolymer P(MMA-AN-VAc) was synthesized by emulsion polymerization and the copolymer membrane was prepared through phase inversion. The structure and the performance of the copolymer, the membrane and the GPE were characterized by FTIR, NMR, SEM, XRD, DSC/TG, LSV, CA, and EIS. It is found that the copolymer was formed through the breaking of double bond C=C in each monomer. The membrane has low crystallinity and has low glass transition temperature, 39.1 degrees C, its thermal stability is as high as 310 degrees C, and its mechanical strength is improved compared with P(MMA-AN). The GPE is electrochemically stable up to 5.6 V (vs. Li/Li+) and its conductivity is 3.48 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at ambient temperature. The lithium ion transference number in the GPE is 0.51 and the conductivity model of the GPE is found to obey the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"A novel glass-ceramic solid electrolyte Li10P3S12I is synthesized, which delivers a high ionic conductivity of 6.4 mS/cm at 25 degrees C and a low activation energy of 0.26 eV. Li10P3S12I also exhibits significantly enhanced stability and low interfacial resistance against Li metal compared with thiophosphates. Tracer-exchange Li NMR reveals that lithium ions transport preferably through the glass phase and glass-ceramic interface in Li10P3S12I. Careful control of the synthesis process to avoid complete crystallization helps stabilize the highly Li-conductive phase.",2
"The redox flow battery is a leading candidate to supply society with large-scale energy storage. In the category of aqueous organic redox flow batteries, 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid (AQDS) is considered a top-performing molecule and shows ideal electrochemical behavior at low concentrations around 1 mM. However, its behavior at higher concentrations was rarely studied. In this work, the correlation between concentration and electrochemical capacity is evaluated for AQDS in 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M alkaline sodium carbonate buffer, employing cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode voltammetry and diffusion NMR. It was found that an electrochemically inactive dimer was formed by the unreduced AQDS molecules, with dimerization equilibrium constants determined to be K = 5 M-1 for the acidic electrolyte and 8 M-1 for the alkaline one, significantly inhibiting full electrochemical utilization of the system. However, upon reduction of the bulk material, the dimerization will shift in favor of monomer or quinhydrone formation, possibly alleviating the impediment to reduction. Finally, it was found that the dimerization could be decreased slightly by increasing the temperature of the system. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"We prepared a semi-IPN (interpenetrating network)-type solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) using poly (ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) as a polymer matrix containing a monocomb-type poly(siloxane-g-allyl cyanide) and poly(ethylene glycol)dimethylether (PEGDME) for the lithium secondary battery. The poly(siloxane-g-allyl cyanide)s were prepared by a hydrosilation reaction of poly (methyl hydrosiloxane) with allyl cyanide and characterized by H-1 NMR and FTIR. The semi-IPN-type electrolyte was prepared by thermal curing, and conductivities of samples were measured by impedance spectroscopy using an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The ionic conductivity of the semi-IPN-polymer electrolyte was about 1.05 X 10(-5) S cm(-1) with 60 wt % of the poly(siloxane-g-allyl cyanide) and 6.96 X 10(-4) S cm(-1) with 50 wt % of the PEGDME and 10 wt % of the poly(siloxane-g-allyl cyanide) at 30 degrees C. The SEM morphology of the cross section of the semi-IPN-polymer electrolyte film was changed from discontinuous network to continuous network as increasing the PEGDME content and decreasing the poly(siloxane-g-allyl cyanide) content. The mechanical stability was also enhanced when increasing the PEGDME content. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
"Trace water content in the electrolyte causes the degradation of LiPF6, and the decomposed products further react with water to produce HF, which alters the surface of anode and cathode. As a result, the reaction of HF and the deposition of decomposed products on electrode surface cause significant capacity fading of cells. Avoiding these phenomena is crucial for lithium ion batteries. Considering the Lewis-base feature of the N-Si bond, 1-(trimethylsilyl)imidazole (1-TMSI) is proposed as a novel water scavenging electrolyte additive to suppress LiPF6 decomposition. The scavenging ability of 1-TMSI and beneficiary interfacial chemistry between the MCMB electrode and electrolyte are studied through a combination of experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. NMR analysis indicated that LiPF6 decomposition by water was effectively suppressed in the presence of 0.2 vol % 1-TMSI. XPS surface analysis of MCMB electrode showed that the presence of 1-TMSI reduced deposition of ionic insulating products caused by LiPF6 decomposition. The results showed that the cells with 1-TMSI additive have better performance than the cell without 1-TMSI by facilitating the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with better ionic conductivity. It is hoped that the work can contribute to the understanding of SEI and the development of electrolyte additives for prolonged cycle life with improved performance.",9
"Magnesium-sulfur batteries are one of the most promising next-generation battery systems due to their high energy density, low cost, and high level of safety. However, the reaction mechanisms are not well understood, and in particular, the discharge reaction products have not yet been identified. Here we show that zinc blende magnesium sulfide is observed as a reaction product after discharging in magnesium-sulfur batteries. When magnesium reacts electrochemically with sulfur in a sulfone-based magnesium electrolyte, sulfur becomes amorphous consisting of magnesium and sulfur in the cathode. In this study, it has been found that the amorphous material has an unusual local structure, which is not related to the most stable rock salt phase of magnesium sulfide but rather the metastable zinc blende phase. It was indicated that this material realizes the reversibility of magnesium-sulfur batteries.",0
"The use of lithium metal as the anode for Lithium Metal Batteries (LMB) requires having solid or quasisolid electrolytes able to block dendrites formation during cell cycling. Here we reported on a hybrid electrolyte membrane based on nanostructured yttria-stabilized-zirconia, sintered by means of High Pressure-Field Assisted Sintering Technique (HP-FAST) in order to retain proper nano-porosity, and activated with a standard LiPF6-EC-DMC solution. By a thorough physico-chemical and functional characterization, we demonstrated that the liquid is effectively nano-confined in the ceramic membrane, and the resulting quasi-solid electrolyte is non-flammable. A remarkable conductivity value of 0.91 mS cm(-1) was observed at room temperature, with activation energy of 0.2 eV, and cation transference number, t(+) = 0.55, substantially higher than that of the pure liquid electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte showed electrochemical stability up to 5.5 V vs. Li+/Li, and excellent resistance to dendrite formation for more than 350 cycles in a Li/electrolyte/Li symmetrical cell. A full cell Li/electrolyte/ LiMn2O4 showed more than 90 mAh g(-1) at 2C for more than 120 cycles. These very promising results indicated that nano-porous ceramic hybrid electrolytes may be conveniently used in LMB. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"In order to combine the advantages of both traditional gel electrolytes and polyelectrolytes, a novel polyelectrolyte which incorporates a boroxine ring-containing anion-trapping agent has been explored. Poly(lithium 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate) (PAMPSLi), ethylene carbonate (EC) and tri(methoxyethoxyethoxyethoxy)boroxine (TME(3)Bx) were combined to prepare various gel systems. The thermal properties and conductivities of these gels have been investigated. A conductivity of 10(-3.6) S cm(-1) at 20 degreesC has been achieved in a gel polyelectrolyte system with a molar ratio of [EC]:[TME(3)Bx]:[Li+] = 24:1.7:1.

"Lithium ion batteries (LIB) can feature reactive anodes that operate at low potentials, such as lithium metal or silicon, passivated by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films. SEI is known to evolve over time as cycling proceeds. In this modeling work, we focus on the stability of two main SEI components, lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC). Both components are electrochemically stable but thermodynamically unstable near the equilibrium Li-4/Li(s) potential. Interfacial reactions represent one way to trigger the intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Both Li2CO3 and LEDC are predicted to exhibit exothermic reactions on lithium metal surfaces, and the barriers are sufficiently low to permit reactions on battery operation time scales. LEDC also readily decomposes on high Li-content LixSi surfaces. Our studies suggest that the innermost SEI layer on lithium metal surfaces should be a thin layer of Li2O, the only thermodynamically and kinetically stable component (in the absence of a fluoride source). This work should also be relevant to inadvertent lithium plating during battery cycling and SEI evolution on LixSi surfaces.",0
"In order to understand the counter anionic effects in a non-aqueous vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), we synthesized four types of electrolyte salts (1-ethyltriethamine tertafluoroborate, [E-TEDA]+[BF4], 1- ethyltriethamine hexafluorophosphate, [E-TEDA]+[PF6], 1-butyltriethylamine tertafluoroborate, [B-TEDA]+[BF4], and 1-buthyltriethamine hexafluorophosphate [B-TEDA]+[PF6]) by counter anion exchange reaction after the SN2 reaction. We confirmed the successful synthesis of the electrolyte salts [E-TEDA]+[Br] and [B-TEDA]+[Br] via 1H-NMR spectroscopy and GC-mass analysis before the counter anion exchange reaction. The electric potential of the vanadium acetylacetonate, V(acac)3, as an energy storage chemical was shown to be 2.2 V in the acetonitrile solvent with each of the [E-TEDA]+[BF4], [E-TEDA]+[PF6], [B-TEDA]+[BF4], and [B-TEDA]+ [PF6] electrolyte salts. In a non-aqueous VRFB with a commercial Neosepta AFN membrane, the maximum voltages reached 1.0 V and 1.5 V under a fixed current value of 0.1 mA in acetonitrile with the [E-TEDA]+[BF4] and [E-TEDA]+[PF6] electrolyte salts, respectively. The maximum voltage was 0.8 V and 1.1 V under a fixed current value of 0.1 mA in acetonitrile with the [B-TEDA]+[BF4] and [B-TEDA]+[PF6] electrolyte salts, respectively. From these results, we concluded that in the non-aqueous VRFB more of the [PF6] counter anion than the [BF4] counter anion was transported onto the commercial Neosepta AFN anion exchange membrane.",0
"Decreasing particle size ensures a good accessibility of LiFePO4 to lithium ions and electrons and allows reaching the theoretical capacity and achieving high cycling rates. It nevertheless leads to an increase of the surface area and thus a subsequent amplification of the parasitic reactions at the interface between active material surface and electrolyte. The formation and evolution of the interphase on the surface of LiFePO4 may affect strongly its electrochemical performance. This work aims at monitoring the interphase forming on LiFePO4 upon its operation in a lithium battery, and correlating its evolution with the electrochemical behaviour of the active material. Combined XPS and multinuclear quantitative Li-7, H-1 and F-19 NMR indicate a trend for the interphase structure that can be described as a mostly stable inner interphase composed of fluorinated inorganic products while outer lithiated organic species undergo a reversible formation at high potential and dissolution at low potential. Although an irreversible accumulation of interphase occurs, spin-spin relaxation time analysis indicates that interphasial species tend to stack on the top of each other rather than cover the whole active material surface. Moreover, the dissolution/precipitation process seems to prevent a blocking of the electrode surface by resistive species such as LiF. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",14
"In this work, the physical, transport and electrochemical properties of various electrolytic solutions containing the 1-propyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis[fluorosulfonyl] imide ([C(3)C(1)pyr][FSI]) mixed with the lithium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl] imide (Li[TFSI]) over a wide range of compositions are reported as a function of temperature at atmospheric pressure. First, the ionicity, lithium transference number, and transport properties (viscosity and conductivity) as well as the volumetric properties (density and molar volume) were determined as a function of lithium salt concentration from 293 to 343 K. Second, the self-diffusion coefficient of each ion in solution was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with pulsed field gradients (PFG). Moreover, an analysis of the collected nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data along with ab initio and COSMO-RS calculations was conducted to depict intra and intermolecular neighbouring within the electrolytic mixtures. Based on this analysis, and as expected, all activation energies increase with the Li[TFSI] concentration in solution, and all activation energies were determined from the self-diffusion data for all ions. Interestingly, regardless of the composition in solution, these activation energies were similar, except for those determined for the [FSI](-)anion. The activation energy of [FSI](-) self-diffusion relatively decreases compared to the other ions as the lithium salt concentration increases. Furthermore, the lithium transference was strongly affected by the lithium salt concentration, reaching an optimal value and an ionicity of approximately 50% at a molality close to 0.75 mol . kg(-1). Finally, these electrolytes were used in lithium-ion batteries (i.e. Li/NMC and LTO/NMC), demonstrating a clear relationship between the electrolyte formulation, its transport parameters and battery performance.",1
"Next-generation electrolytes for Lithium Ion Batteries (LIBs) must provide increased durability, reliability, safety, and scalability to meet the even more stringent technical requirements of crucial industries such as e-mobility. A promising strategy to merge these technical needs is the development of easy-to-prepare gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) able to ensure satisfactory conductivity, high stability, and reduced flammability. In this study, we propose the preparation of novel nanocomposite GPEs through one-pot in-situ photo-polymerization (UVcuring), which turns out to be of great interest due to its low-cost, solvent-free and energy-saving characteristics. Poly (ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) was used as hosting polymer matrix, while 1 M Lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC) was used as electrolyte solution. Organo-modified montmorillonite (fMt, intercalated with CTAB) was synthesized and tested as a nanofiller. Both materials and GPEs were characterized by a combination of experimental techniques including FTIR, XRD, SEM, and DMA. Noteworthy, a thorough and systematic study of the lithium-ion transport properties in the prepared GPEs was carried out using pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFGNMR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This preliminary study demonstrated the gP-fMt combines ease of preparation and excellent safety (i.e., thermomechanical stability up to 250 degrees C and nonflammability) with satisfactory lithium transport properties.",0
"This study is intended to develop an aqueous zinc/polyindole secondary battery system. Polyindole, which is synthesized by chemical oxidation using ammonium peroxydisulfate as oxidants, is used as cathode active materials. Zn foil and ZnCl(2) are used as anode active materials and the electrolytic solution, respectively. FTIR and NMR test are carried out to confirm the polymerization of indole and the chemical structure of polyindole. The performance of zinc/polyindole secondary battery system is evaluated in term of cyclic voltammogram, discharge capacity and durability test. The battery achieves 2.0 V during the charging process and shows about 80-60 Ah kg(-1) discharge capacity at discharge current density of 200-1000 A m(-2), respectively. The battery is successively charged and discharged at constant current densities, the discharge capacity density and energy density decreases only by 2.0% and 3.5% at 200th cycle. respectively. This result shows that the zinc/polyindole battery has the good characteristics of charge/discharge performance.

"While salt-in-ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes provide a promising alternative to organic electrolytes, they suffer from large ionic clusters impeding lithium ion transport. Here, a lithium-coordinating polymer is added and the transition from salt-in-IL to IL-based ternary polymer gel electrolytes is followed, investigating the influence of the composition on Li transport mechanisms. The electrolyte is composed of the salt lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA), the IL 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium (Pyr(14)) TFSA, and a variable amount of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Impedance spectroscopy, multinuclear (H-1, Li-7, and F-19) diffusion NMR and electrophoretic NMR (eNMR) yield electrophoretic mobilities, transference numbers, partial conductivities, and effective charges of all ionic species. As the polymer fraction increases, the lithium ion drift direction is inverted. The sign reversal of Li+ mobility and transference number occurs at the optimum coordination of 5-6 ethylene oxide units per Li+ ion. The dominant Li+ transport mechanism shifts from a vehicular transport via anionic clusters to chain-dominated transport mechanisms. It is concluded that the lithium transport properties of IL-based electrolytes can be vastly improved by the addition of PEO. Tuning the composition of the ternary electrolyte reveals optimal Li+ transport properties at moderately high polymer contents as well as high salt concentrations.",16
"According to Coulomb's law, besides the design of bulky anion, increase in dielectric constant can also reduce the electrostatic attraction force, both of which are benefit for ion dissociation. Here, we report a zwitterionic single ion conducting polymer electrolyte by chemically grafting two propanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide groups to the nitrogen of poly(biphenyl piperidium) (PBP-g-Li(PSI)2). One of side-chain groups burdens negative charge to counterbalance the positive charge of quaternary ammonium of main chain, and the other one provides lithium ion to conduct charge. Poly(biphenyl piperidinium) grafted with one lithium propanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PBP-g-LiPSI) is synthesized for contrast. It is discovered that the dielectric constant of PBP-g-Li(PSI)2 is 22.3 at 2 MHz which is 3.5 times that of PBP-g-LiPSI, and the ionic conductivity of PBPg-Li(PSI)2 gel polymer electrolyte membrane is 2.41 x 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 degrees C, nearly twice that of PBP-g-LiPSI gel polymer electrolyte membrane. The dipole structure of bonded bis(sulfonyl)imide anion and quaternary ammonium cation can shield the electrostatic attraction between lithium cation and immobilized anion as confirmed by Li 1s XPS and 7Li NMR. Zwitterionic polymer electrolyte not only withstands galvanostatic cycling in lithium symmetric cell at +/- 0.5 mA cm-2@2 mAh cm-2 for 2000 h, but also performs stably in lithium metal secondary battery.",0
"The addition of diluents to ionic liquids (ILs) has recently been shown to enhance the transport properties of ILs. In the context of electrolyte design, this enhancement allows the realisation of IL-based electrolytes for metal-air batteries and other storage devices. It is likely that diluent addition not only impacts the viscosity of the IL, but also the ion-ion interactions and structure. Here, we investigate the nano-structured 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium chloride (OMImCl) with varying water concentrations in the presence of two metal salts, zinc chloride and magnesium chloride. We find that the choice of metal salt has a significant impact on the structure and transport properties of the system; this is explained by the water structuring and destructing properties of the metal salt.",0
"The present study highlights the electrochemical performance of two series of fluorinated graphites used as the cathode in primary lithium batteries. These compounds were prepared under fluorine gas at room temperature using a catalytic atmosphere made of boron or chlorine fluoride, and then thermally treated between 100 and 600 degrees C. The electrochemical properties are correlated to a complete physico-chemical characterization, already performed by XRD, NMR, FT-IR and EPR. In particular, important parameters are taken into account: C-F bonding, carbon hybridization, fluorine content (i.e. F/C ratio) and amount of intercalated catalyst residues. It is shown that the average discharge potential of fluorinated graphite used in primary lithium batteries can be predicted owing to the chemical shift values (delta(C-F)) obtained by solid C-13 NMR. On the other hand, the higher capacity values are achieved for low temperature fluorinated graphite treated at the highest temperatures, i.e. for high fluorination level. The electrochemical performance study of these materials is completed by the study of the effect of simulated storage. The differences between the various samples during electrochemical tests and those observed using different electrolytes are discussed. Fluorinated graphites obtained with a chlorine catalyst or post-treated at temperatures higher than 450 degrees C are unaffected by ageing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"The impact of electrode formation is studied by the spatially and time-resolved distribution of transverse relaxation. In situ(7)Li nuclear magnetic resonance experiments are performed on an experimental lithium-ion battery cell to study the impact of electrode passivation via imaging and transverse relaxation in the interelectrode volume. The electrolyte in the battery, using technically relevant electrode material, i.e., graphite and lithium-nickel-cobalt-manganese-oxide, is studied by 2D magnetic resonance imaging. The electrolyte is 1 mol L(-1)lithium hexafluorophosphate dissolved in a binary mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate. 1D profiles are acquired and related to(7)Li concentration during passivation and during a constant current/constant voltage cycle. The transverse relaxation rateR(2)(z,t) measured by multiecho profiles revealed changes within the electrolyte volume. The ongoing process changes the relaxation distribution. Indications for a defective electrode passivation are deduced from the data. During one charging cycle with constant current/constant voltage, the lithium concentration is measured spatially resolved, and the data are modeled by the Nernst-Planck equation.",9
"Electrolytic dissociation of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in the nonaqueous cyclic propylene carbonate (PC) has been investigated in the wide range of concentration (0.05-3.5 M) by Li-7 solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Two-dimensional heteronuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy NMR experiments have not only enabled the cation solvation and ion-pairing to be directly monitored but additionally evidence anion solvent interaction at higher concentrations (>1.2 M) of the PC electrolyte. Preliminary analysis of kinetic nOe data has been made to determine site-dependent cross-relaxation rates for the spatial interaction of the solvent with the Li+ cation and the PF6- anion. The concentration dependence of the Li-7 NMR self-diffusion coefficient (D-self), determined using very strong pulsed magnetic field gradients (similar to 1700 Gauss/cm), depicts two breaks to mark the solvation and ion-pairing events in a distinct manner. This in turn has aided the determination of solvent coordination number and average sizes of solvated and ion-paired clusters. Our results indicate that in the contact ion pair (CIP)-dominated electrolyte (>2 M), lithium-ion mobility across the solvated and ion-paired environments appears to be inhibited which makes the spectral distinction of solvated and ion-paired environments possible. The concentration dependence of the Li-7 NMR spectral and diffusometry data is in striking correspondence with that of bulk conductivity measurements and point to the detrimental effect of CIP aggregates in impeding the ionic conductivity at high salt concentrations. These results have significance in understanding the structure and dynamics of lithium-ion solvates that are ubiquitous in the working environment of a lithium-ion battery.",0
The Li1+xTi2-xFex(PO4)(3)/C series with 0 <= 5 <= 0.4 was prepared by a sol-gel method. XRD patterns showed a rhombohedral phase and minor contribution of an orthorhombic phase. The local environment of the phosphate structure was analyzed by P-31 MAS NMR spectroscopy. The electrochemical lithium insertion revealed two reversible regions for Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ti4+/Ti3+ reactions as confirmed by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy. Capacity values as large as 130 mA h g(-1) were recorded for Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)(3)/C after 40 cycles. The drastic decrease in capacity observed for LiTi2(PO4)(3)/C cycled at C/2 was explained in terms of a lower kinetic response at the electrode-electrolyte interphase.,0
"Cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers derived from electrolyte oxidative decomposition can passivate the cathode surface and prevent its direct contact with electrolyte. The inorganics-dominated inner solid electrolyte layer (SEL) and organics-rich outer quasi-solid-electrolyte layer (qSEL) constitute the CEI layer, and both merge at the junction without a clear boundary, which assures the CEI layer with both ionic-conducting and electron-blocking properties. However, the typical wash-then-test pattern of characterizations aiming at the microstructure of CEI layers would dissolve the qSEL and even destroy the SEL, leading to an overanalysis of electrolyte decomposition pathway and misassignment of CEI architecture (e.g., component and morphology). In this study, we established a full-dimensional characterization paradigm (combining Fourier transform infrared, solution NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry technologies) and reconstructed the original CEI layer model. Besides, the feasibility of this characterization paradigm has been verified in a wide operating voltage range on a typical LiNixMnyCozO2 cathode.",16
"The Nation membrane is a critical component in redox flow batteries, which are widely investigated for grid-scale energy storage. However, there is very limited understanding of the fundamental properties of the membrane materials in the working environment relevant to redox flow batteries. This paper presents results of the analysis of the Nafion-117 membrane used in a vanadium redox flow battery by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The XPS study reveals the chemical identity and environment of vanadium cations accumulated at the surface. On the other hand, the O-17 NMR measurement explores the nature of the diffused vanadium cations inside the bulk part of the Nation and shows the chemical bonding of cations and the host membrane. The F-19 NMR shows that the basic Nafion structure is not altered by the vanadium cations diffused inside. Based on these spectroscopic studies, the chemical identity and environment of the diffused vanadium cations in the Nafion membrane are discussed. This study reveals important information on the origin of performance degradation of the membrane materials in vanadium redox flow batteries and provides clues on how to improve the chemistry and properties of the energy storage devices.

"We evaluated and compared the physical properties of electrolyte solutions consisting of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide and sulfone solvents (molar ratio =1 : 3) and their mixtures containing aluminum oxide (alpha-Al2O3) or lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZ) particles of various particle sizes. Sulfolane (SL), 3-methylsulfolane, and ethyl isopropyl sulfone were evaluated as sulfone solvents for the electrolyte solutions. The phase-change heat, phase-change temperature, and spin-spin relaxation time in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements decrease in a mixture of SL electrolyte with a metal oxide, with an apparent average liquid thickness in the order of nm resulting from the SL electrolyte solution. This indicates a decrease in molecular mobility around the particle surface. For the alpha-Al2O3 system, no substantial changes are observed in the activation energy of ionic conductivity, self-diffusion coefficient of Li+ (determined via pulsed -field gradient NMR), or relative cross-peak intensities of Li+ and 1H of SL in the two-dimensional NMR of the mixture. Therefore, despite its low molecular mobility, the SL electrolyte solution at the solid-liquid interface is considered to exhibit an ionic conductivity mechanism similar to that of the bulk electrolyte. It was suggested that LLZ system has a different ionic conduction mechanism than alpha- Al2O3 system. (c) The Author(s) 2023. Published by ECSJ.

"In this study, amine ended block co-polymers of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide units are reacted separately with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) and (3-isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane (ICPTES) and then mixed in different weight ratios to obtain ion conductive and mechanically stable hybrid solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Various characterization techniques are employed to explore the morphology, thermal stability, molecular interaction, backbone structure and dynamic behavior of the blend hybrid SPEs. The hybrid SPE exhibits the maximum ionic conductivity of 1.1 x 10(-4)S cm-1 at 30 degrees C. The electrochemical stability window of hybrid SPEs varies from 4.5 to 4.7 V, depending on salt concentration. Moreover, the salt free hybrid membrane is plasticized in an organic electrolyte solvent to enhance the ionic conductivity to an exceptionally high value of 2.4 x 10(-2)S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C and 1.8 x 10(-1)S cm(-1) at 70 degrees C. The test cell consists of plasticized blend hybrid membrane delivers an initial discharge capacity of 142.5 rnAh g(-1) and retains 92% of initial capacity after 70 cycles with coulombic efficiency value of over 99%. Our results show that the blend hybrid electrolytes can be a promising electrolyte system for applications in high energy density lithium-ion batteries.",0
"The long-range Li ion diffusion in Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) (LAGP), a NASICON-type glass ceramic conductor with high ionic conductivity, was studied using pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) Li-7 NMR. LAGP is stable in air and water, and can be used for all-solid Li batteries as well as next generation Li-air batteries. The Li ion conduction mechanisms in the micrometer space are important for the design of Li batteries and development of new materials. Our previous studies on sulfide-based and garnet-type solid conductors showed that uniform Li+ ion diffusion is hampered by narrow pathways surrounded by stationary anions. The Li ions are engaged in parameter-dependent diffusion with the parameters being observation time (D) and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) strength (g); this is completely different from the Li diffusion in solution and polymer electrolytes, and also from molecular diffusion in neutral porous media. In this study, we observed apparent diffusion constant (D-apparent) values for the LAGP, that were almost continuously distributed within a limited range at a certain Delta. At very long observation times (above 300 ms) and large g (similar to 13 Tm-1), an equilibrated diffusion constant (close to the tracer diffusion constant) could be observed. The apparent activation energy of Li ion diffusion was about 16 kJ mol(-1), which was smaller than the activation energy for the ionic conductivity. The temperature-dependent carrier ion numbers were estimated.",0
"Using information gained from parallel investigations on lithiated/over-lithiated graphite and hard carbon, we propose two different processes for lithium nucleation and dendrite growth in the carbon allotropes based on their different crystal structures. In the case of graphite, lithium nucleation and initial growth of lithium dendrites occur inhomogeneously on the graphite surfaces during the over-lithiation process, which exposes lithium nucleation to the electrolyte causing formation of a large amount of electrolyte degradation products (EDPs) and knob-like dendrites covered with a thick lithium electrolyte interphase (LEI). However, in the, case of hard carbon, lithium nucleation and initial growth occur inside the hard carbon nanopores, which limits side reactions, provides a higher capacity (similar to 550 mA h/g vs similar to 370 mA h/g for graphite), and generates dendrites with smooth clean surfaces during the over-lithiation process. These findings could profoundly influence the overall electrode design, the improvement of performance, and the inherent safety of carbon-based electrodes for lithium ion batteries.",0
"Solution-state 2D correlation experiments increase signal-to-noise,provide improved resolution, and inform about molecular connectivity.NMR experiments are compromised when the nuclei have broad chemicalshift ranges that exceed the bandwidth of the experiment. Spectraacquired under these conditions are unphasable and artifact-prone,and peaks may disappear from the spectrum altogether. Existing remediesprovide usable spectra only in specific experimental contexts. Here,we introduce a general broadband strategy that leads to a libraryof high performing NMR experiments. We achieve arbitrary and independentevolution of NMR interactions by only changing delays in our pulseblock, letting the block replace inversion elements in any NMR experiment.The experiments improve the experimental bandwidth for both nucleiby an order of magnitude over conventional sequences, covering chemicalshift ranges of most molecules, even at ultrahigh field. This libraryenables robust spectroscopy of molecules such as perfluorinated oils(F-19{C-13}) and fluorophosphorous compounds inbattery electrolytes (F-19{P-31}).",9
"The search for cost-effective stationary energy storage systems has led to a surge of reports on novel post-Li-ion batteries composed entirely of earth-abundant chemical elements. Among the plethora of contenders in the ‘beyond lithium’ domain, the aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their low cost and high theoretical volumetric and gravimetric energy densities (3177 Wh L−1 and 1392 Wh kg−1). In this work, we offer an overview of historical and present research pursuits in the development of Al–S batteries with particular emphasis on their fundamental problem—the dissolution of polysulfides. We examine both experimental and computational approaches to tailor the chemical interactions between the sulfur host materials and polysulfides, and conclude with our view on research directions that could be pursued further.",7
"Aluminum–Sulfur (Al–S) batteries are regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their high energy-to-price ratios and safety. However, they suffer from clumsy S ↔ Al2S3 reactions and short lifespans that limit their practical application. By combining the merits of adsorptive Cu, catalytic Co, and conductive N-doped carbon matrix, the bimetals decorated N-doped carbon (Cu1Co1@NC) enables smooth adsorption and conversion of polysulfides. Consequently, the S@Cu1Co1@NC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (delivering a high capacity of 317.5 mAh g−1 after 320 cycles at 1.5 A g−1). Moreover, the Cu-endowed strong Al affinity and robust 3D scaffold with Co-enhanced conductivity can regulate Al3+ depositing/stripping and successfully suppress Al dendrites. As a result, the Cu1Co1@NC displays negligible Al nucleation overpotential and provides ultra-long lifespan (>10 000 h) and exceptional reversible (Coulombic efficiency = 99.8–99.9%) Al3+ plating/stripping. Integrating all these advantages, a full Al–S cell constructed with Cu1Co1@NC as two-in-one hosts demonstrates excellent capacity retention with enhanced reversibility. This work provides insights into the design of promising Al–S batteries based on bifunctional CuCo bimetal and favorable 3D framework.",7
"The Al−S battery is a promising next-generation battery candidate due to high abundance of both aluminium and sulfur. However, the sluggish kinetics of the Al−S battery reactions produces very high overpotentials. Here, for the first time, it was demonstrated that the incorporation of redox mediators could dramatically improve the kinetics of Al−S batteries. On the example of iodide redox mediators, it was shown that the charging voltage of Al−S batteries could be decreased by about 0.23 V with as little as 2.3 wt% of redox mediator added as electrolyte additive. Control electrochemical measurements, without prior discharge of the battery, demonstrated that >97 % of the charge capacity was due to the desired oxidation of Al2S3 and polysulfides, and X-ray diffraction experiments confirmed the formation of sulfur as the final charge product. The beneficial role of redox mediators was demonstrated with cheap and environmentally friendly electrolytes made of urea and AlCl3. This work showed that dramatic performance improvements could be achieved with low concentration of electrolyte additives, and therefore, much further performance improvements could be sought by combining multiple additives.",7
"Aluminum-ion batteries have attracted great attention in virtue of their reliable safety performance and cost-effective raw materials. The sulfur element with a high specific capacity gives great development space for aluminum-sulfur (Al–S) battery. However, the dissolution of sulfur in electrolyte hinders the application of Al–S battery. Carbon materials with porous structure has larger specific surface area for adsorption of sulfur, and the porous carbon for sulfur cathode provides a certain barrier for the shuttle effect during the charge-discharge process. In this work, hollow carbon synthesized by template method is applied to Al–S batteries. It is found that the cave-like porous carbon material provides space for storing sulfur and polysulfides, alleviating the sulfur shuttle effect in Al–S batteries. The specific capacity of the hollow carbon materials for Al–S batteries is 1027 mAh g−1 at the first cycle and the rechargeable specific capacity achieves 378 mAh g−1 after 28 cycle.",7
"The lack of knowledge on electrochemical reaction pathways for Al/S batteries prevents the development of practical approaches to mitigate the irreversibility and poor cycling performances of this appealing secondary battery system, which is, in theory, scalable, inexpensive, and energy-dense. Different from the Li/S system, Al/S batteries use ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes. The choice of the IL, i.e., whether the IL is based on a conventional EMImCl-based electrolyte or in a deep eutectic mixture of aluminum chloride with urea (or any of its derivatives), strongly affects the electrochemical energy-storage performance of the cell. To shed some light on the Al/S battery chemistry, here, we present the computational electrochemistry research work to determine the most favorable reaction pathways and thermodynamically stable reaction intermediates. We also discuss the effect of the coordination of ionic species (originated from aluminum-containing deep eutectic electrolytes) with polysulfide intermediates, which lead to alterations in the reaction pathway and electrochemical behavior of the Al/S system. The spectroscopic signatures from various reaction intermediates are also reported and validated via comparison with experimental observations.",7
"The rigorous requirements, such as high abundance, cost-effectiveness, and increased storage capacities, pose severe challenges to the existing Li-ion batteries' long-term sustainability. Room-temperature aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) chemistry, in particular, is gaining importance due to its high theoretical energy density (1700 W h kg−1). Al–S battery technology is one of the emerging metal–sulfur candidates that can surpass current Li-ion chemistries. When coupled with sulfur, aluminum metal brings a cheap and energy-rich option to existing battery technologies. Owing to the unique virtues of the Al–S battery, it has garnered increasing interest among scientific communities. Al–S chemistry has been investigated for quite some time, yet the cell performance remained in its infancy, which poses a challenge to this technology's viability. Besides stabilizing the Al metal anode, the most important challenge in the practical development of Al–S batteries is the development of a suitable sulfur cathode material. Owing to the complexity of this multivalent system, numerous factors have been taken into account, but the best sulfur cathode is yet to be identified. A detailed exploration of sulfur cathodes and their implications on the battery performance are discussed in this mini-review article. We present a detailed picture of cathode materials that may serve as the reference guide for developing more practical cathode materials. Also, fundamental principles and challenges encountered in the development of the sulfur cathodes are highlighted. Through the knowledge disseminated in this mini-review, the development in the multivalent post-Li-ion battery can be accelerated. A glimpse of the future outlook on the Al–S battery system with different potential solutions is also discussed.",7
"Instrumented battery cells (i.e. those containing sensors) and smart cells (with integrated control and communication circuitry) are essential for the development of the next-generation battery technologies, such as Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs). The mapping and monitoring of parameters, for example the quantification of temperature gradients, helps improve cell designs and optimise management systems. Integrated sensors must be protected against the harsh cell electrolytic environment. State-of-the-art coatings include the use of Parylene polymer (our reference case).We applied three new types of coatings (acrylic, polyurethane and epoxy based) to thermistor arrays mounted on flexible printed circuit board (PCBs). We systematically analyse the coatings: (i) PCB submersion within electrolyte vials (8 weeks); (ii) analysis of sample inserted into coin cell; (iii) analysis of sensor and cell performance data for 1Ah pouch SIBs. Sodium-based liquid electrolyte was selected, consisting of a 1 M solution of sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate in a ratio of 3:7 (v/v%). Our novel experiments revealed that the epoxy based coated sensors offered reliable temperature measurements; superior performance observed compared to the Parylene sensors (erroneous results from one sample were reported, under 5 d submersed in electrolyte).Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed in the case of most coatings tested, formation of additional species occurred during exposure to the different coatings applied to the PCBs. The epoxy-based coating demonstrated resilience to the electrolytic-environment, as well as minimal effect on cell performance (capacity degradation compared to unmodified-reference, within 2% for the coin cell, and within 3.4% for pouch cell). The unique methodology detailed in this work allows sensor coatings to be trialled in a realistic and repeatable cell environment. This study demonstrated for the first time that this epoxy-based coating enables scalable, affordable, and resilient sensors to be integrated towards next-generation Smart SIBs.",1
"In this work, a series of trifluoroethyl aliphatic carboxylates with different carbon-chain lengths in acyl group are prepared and investigated as the co-solvents for the carbonate-based electrolyte of lithium-ion batteries. The trifluoroethyl aliphatic carbonates are synthesized by a modified one-step approach, using aliphatic carboxylic acid and trifluoroethanol as the raw materials (molar ratio, 1.2:1), hydrogen ion exchange resin as the catalyst and silica gel drier as the de-hydration. The structure and electrochemical properties of the final products have been characterized by FTIR, H-1 NMR, GC-MS, viscosity, conductivity meter and electrochemical measurements. The structure characterizations show that the final products have high purity. Electrochemical tests present that the co-solvents are able to improve the electrochemical performances of graphite electrode at low temperature. In particular, we find that an addition of trifluoroethyl n-hexanoate (TFENH) into 1 M LiPF6/EC + EMC electrolyte can significantly decrease the Li de-intercalation potential of graphite by 540 mV and achieve a high capacity retention of 92% at 218 K. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicate that the observed performance improvement at low temperature is associated with the decreased surface film resistance (R-SEI) by the addition of co-solvents.

"In order to estimate the ionic transference number precisely the equipment of the direct current (DC) NMR measurement (the pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR by applying a direct electric field) was improved with an electric field control technique using a four-terminal electrophoretic sample cell. It was found that this technique was appropriate to achieve the constant electric field condition at the NMR detected section. The ionic mobilities of the cation and anion of the lithium gel electrolyte, 1 M LiN(CF3SO2)(2)-EC/DEC-PVdF-HFP, were measured individually using the modified apparatus. The transport number of lithium ion obtained from the ionic mobilities of lithium ion and counter anion group was different from the apparent value estimated from the diffusion coefficients of the lithium and anion species, This disagreement was due to the ion-pair component in diffusion coefficients. It indicated that the DC-NMR was more precise technique for estimating the transference number of ions than the simple PGSE-NMR. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Polymer gel electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and mechanical ductility are produced using a slide-ring (SR) gel swollen with an electrolyte solution (ES) composed of propylene carbonate (PC) and lithium salt. The SR gel was derived from polyrotaxane (PR), in which cyclic molecules known as cyclodextrins (CDs) are threaded on the axial polymer chain of polyethylene glycol (PEG) capped by bulky ends, through intermolecular crosslinking between the CDs. The molar conductivity of the SR gel electrolyte with a high swelling ratio and small crosslinking density was more than 95% for pristine ES, and the activation energy and potential window of the SR gel electrolyte was close to that of pristine ES. The compressive properties of the SR gel electrolyte were also investigated; the Young's modulus of the SR gel electrolyte decreased with the crosslinking density and the SR gel electrolyte with a low crosslinking density was not fractured under compression to almost half of the original thickness.

"Lithium metal anode is coated with poly(arylene ether sulfone)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) (PAES-g-PEG) to enhance the electrochemical and anti-oxidation stability of lithium secondary battery. PAES-g-PEG is synthesized via condensation between mechanically rigid PAES and lithium ion (Li+) conductive PEG, and its synthesis is well confirmed using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy. Several important structures and properties are characterized, investigating morphology, electrolyte uptake, Li+ conductivity, interfacial resistance, thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis shows a distinct phase separation between PAES and PEG in presence of organic liquid electrolyte. This phase separation results in excellent mechanical properties of 4.0 MPa tensile strength and 60% elongation at break as well as high Li+ conductivity of 0.275 +/- 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature. Although the bare lithium metal is easily oxidized by air and liquid electrolyte, the PAES-g-PEG protected one shows high anti-oxidation stability against both environments from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic forced microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Due to the significant suppression of lithium dendrite formation and growth, the LNMCO/PP/Li-L cell protected by PAES-g-PEG is capable of delivering 102 mAh g(-1), preserving 96% of its initial discharge capacity over 100 cycles at 0.2 C-rate.",0
"To enhance battery safety, it is of utmost importance to develop non-flammable electrolytes. An emerging concept within this research field is the development of localized highly concentrated electrolytes (LHCEs). This type of liquid electrolyte relies on the concept of highly concentrated electrolytes (HCEs), but possesses lower viscosity, improved conductivity and reduced costs due to the addition of diluent solvents. In this work, two different hydrofluoroethers, i.e., bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE) and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE), are studied as diluents in a phosphate-based non-flammable liquid electrolyte. These two solvents were added to a highly concentrated electrolyte of 3.0 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in triethyl phosphate (TEP) whereby the salt concentration was diluted to 1.5 M. The solvation structures of the HCE and LHCE were studied by means of Raman spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where the latter was shown to be essential to provide more detailed insights. By using molecular dynamics simulations, it was shown that a highly concentrated Li+-TEP solvation sheath is formed, which can be protected by the diluents TTE and BTFE. These simulations have also clarified the energetic interaction between the components in the LHCE, which supports the experimental results from the viscosity and the NMR measurements. By performing non-covalent interaction analysis (NCI) it was possible to show the main contributions of the observed chemical shifts, which indicated that TTE has a stronger effect on the solvation structure than BTFE. Moreover, the electrochemical performances of the electrolytes were evaluated in half-cells (Li|NMC622, Li|graphite), full-cells (NMC622|graphite) and Li metal cells (Li|Cu). Galvanostatic cycling has shown that the TTE based electrolyte performs better in full-cells and Li-metal cells, compared to the BTFE based electrolyte. Operando pressure measurements have indicated that no significant amount of gases is evolved in NMC622|graphite cells using the here presented LHCEs, while a cell with 1.0 M LiFSI in TEP displayed clear formation of gaseous products in the first cycles. The formation of gaseous products is accompanied by solvent co-intercalation, as shown by operando XRD, and quick cell failure. This work provides insights on understanding the solvation structure of LHCEs and highlights the relationship between electrochemical performance and pressure evolution.",8
"Sodium-based batteries are being considered to replace Li-based batteries for the fabrication of large-scale energy storage devices. One of the main obstacles is the lack of safe and conductive solid Na-ion electrolytes. A Na-ion polymer based on the (4-styrenesulfonyl(trifluromethylsulfonyl) imide anion, Na [STFSI], has been prepared by a radical polymerization process and its conductive properties determined. In addition, a number of multi-component polymers were synthetized by co-reaction of two monomers: Na[STFSI] and ethyl acrylate (EA) at different ratios. The structural and phase characterizations of the polymers were probed by various techniques (DSC, TGA, NMR, GPC, Raman, FTIR and Impedance spectroscopy). Comparative studies with blends of the homopolymers Na[PSTFSI] and poly(ethylacrylate) (PEA) have also been performed. The polymers are all thermally stable up to 300 degrees C and the ionic conductivity of EA copolymers and EA blends are about 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of Na [PSTFSI]. The highest conductivity measured at 100 degrees C was found for Na[PSTFSI-blend-5EA] at 7.9 x 10(-9) S cm(-1), despite being well below its T-g. Vibrational spectroscopy indicates interaction between Na+ and the EA carbonyl groups, with a concomitant decrease in the sulfonyl interaction, facilitating Na+ motion, as well as lowering T-g.

"Lithium ion capacitors (LICs) are emerging as promising energy storage devices; thus, understanding their electrochemistry is of great interest. Here we report the study of a novel LIC by employing in situ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) as a nondestructive tool, revealing the sequence of electrochemical processes in it. We have performed in situ Li-7 NMR experiments on the LIC by simultaneously cycling the LIC pouch cell in the voltage range 2.0-4.0 V. NMR spectra recorded for multiple cycles reveal the Li-7 NMR signals arising from different parts of the capacitor. By employing a combination of in situ Li-7 NMR, component isolation, and Gaussian-Lorentzian peak fitting, we investigate the resonances arising from the Li metal from stabilized lithium metal powder (SLMP), free ions in electrolyte, the solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI), intercalated lithium in carbon anode, and the Li ions in the electric double layer on cathode. The recorded in situ Li-7 NMR spectra showed that the charge and discharge processes caused electrochemical reactions, resulting in considerable repetitive changes in peak intensities and chemical shifts over multiple cycles. Further cycle experiments revealed contributions from individual electrodes. This series of experiments aid in the visualization of the Li ion transfer mechanisms in LICs.",0
"Electrospun fibrous membranes of composites of polyvinylidene fluoride and polyacrylonitrile (PVdF-PAN-ESFMs) are prepared with different proportions of PAN (25, 50 and 75%, w/w). The morphology of the ESFMs is examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). FESEM image of PVdF-ESFM reveals that the fibers have uniform diameters and smooth surfaces. However, the fibers of PVdF-PAN-ESFMs are interconnected with large number of voids and cavities of different sizes. These voids are effectively utilized for the preparation of polymer electrolytes by loading lithium perchlorate dissolved in propylene carbonate. PVdF-PAN-ESFM with 25% PAN (designated as PVdF-PAN(25)-ESFM) could load a high amount of lithium salt with electrolyte uptake of more than 300%. PVdF-PAN(25)-ESFM electrolyte exhibits a high conductivity of 7.8 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and electro-chemically stable up to 5.1 V. Also, the addition of PAN into PVdF decreases the interfacial resistance with lithium electrode. PVdF-PAN-ESFM electrolytes have complementary advantageous characteristics of PVdF and PAN. The promising results reported here clearly indicate that polymer electrolytes based on PVdF-PAN-ESFMs are most suited for lithium batteries. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Polyphosphonates, a class of polymers with the generic formula -[P(R)(X)-OR'O](n)-, exhibit a high degree of modularity due to the range of R, R', and X groups that can be incorporated. As such, these polymers may be designed with a polyethylene oxide (PEO) backbone (R' group) and employed as solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Two PEO-containing polyphosphonate analogs (R = Ph; X = S or Se) were doped with LiPF6 and their conductivities were measured. Conductivities were similar (X = S) to or exceeding (X = Se) those of standard PEO systems (just below 10(-4) S/cm at 100 degrees C). Binding models for Li+ were generated using P-31{H-1}NMR titration experiments. Binding of Li+ by these polyphosphonates followed a positive cooperativity model, and varying the X group (S or Se) affected the observed cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 1.73 and 4.16, respectively). The presence of Se also leads to an increase in conductivity as temperature is raised above the T-g, which is likely an effect of reduced Columbic interactions. Because of their modularity and ease with which cation binding can be evaluated using P-31{H-1} NMR titration experiments, polyphosphonates offer a unique approach for the modification of Li+ ion battery technology.",1
"Hard carbon (HC) is the state-of-the-art anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its performance has been plagued by the limited initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and mediocre rate performance. Here, experimental and theoretical studies are combined to demonstrate the application of lithium-pretreated HC (LPHC) as high-performance anode materials for SIBs by manipulating the solid electrolyte interphase in tetraglyme (TEGDME)-based electrolyte. The LPHC in TEGDME can 1) deliver > 92% ICE and approximate to 220 mAh g(-1) specific capacity, twice of the capacity (approximate to 100 mAh g(-1)) in carbonate electrolyte; 2) achieve > 85% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1) current density (4 C rate, 1 C = 250 mA g(-1)) with a specific capacity of approximate to 150 mAh g(-1), approximate to 15 times of the capacity (10 mAh g(-1)) in carbonate. The full cell of Na3V2(PO4)(3)-LPHC in TEGDME demonstrated close to theoretical specific capacity of approximate to 98 mAh g(-1) based on Na3V2(PO4)(3) cathode, approximate to 2.5 times of the value (approximate to 40 mAh g(-1)) with nontreated HC. This work provides new perception on the anode development for SIBs.",0
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and complex impedance spectroscopy have been used to study the polymer electrolytes formed by amylopectin rich starch, plasticized with glycerol and containing lithium perchlorate. The 7Li and 1H NMR linewidth narrowing occurs close to the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the plasticized electrolytes. The heteronuclear decoupling NMR experiments suggest a weaker Li–polymer interaction in the plasticized electrolyte when compared with the unplasticized ones. The effects of the plasticizer on the ionic mobility in these starch-based electrolytes, as measured by NMR spin-lattice relaxation and conductivity, are discussed. The 7Li NMR relaxation results indicate that the ionic mobility in these plasticized electrolytes seems to be controlled by the plasticizer molecules. The dynamical parameters obtained from the conductivity and NMR data demonstrate that the Li+ mobility in our systems is comparable to those found in others plasticized polymer electrolytes.",8
"Direct internal pressure measurements of the cylindrical Li-ion cells with a mixture of LiCoO2 and Li1.167Ni0.233Co0.1Mn0.467Mo0.033O2 (a solid solution between 0.4 Li2Mn0.8Ni0.1Mo0.1O3 and 0.6 LiNi(0.4)ACo(0.2)Mn(0.4)O(2)) as cathode and graphite as anode have been performed during cell charging. Cell internal pressure at the end of charging is greatly reduced from 2.85 to 0.84-1.84 bar by adding a small amount of phosphorus derivatives such as triphenyl phosphine (TPP), ethyl diphenylphosphinite (EDP), and triethyl phosphite (TEP) into a carbonate-based electrolyte. The phosphorus derivatives are supposed to react with O-2 generated from the decomposition of the Li2MnO3 component. The chemical states of additive molecules before and after the charging process have been characterized with a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It has also been shown that those additives improve the cycle life when applied in coin full cells. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",16
"Redox flow batteries (RFBs) possess multiple advantages as a flexible energy storage solution. However, RFB researchers are still facing many challenges in finding an appropriate electrolyte. Microemulsions have recently been proposed as a promising alternative RFB electrolyte because of their ability to accommodate organic redox species with fast electron transfer rates that are not soluble in aqueous phase, while still offering the high conductivity of an aqueous salt electrolyte. In this work, we focused on understanding the transport of ferrocene (Fc) in a toluene/Tween 20/1-butanol/water model microemulsion and studied the compositional influence on Fc diffusion. The results show that Fc redistributes among the oil, surfactant, and water microenvironments, and the corresponding diffusion and partition coefficients are quantified. Thus, a tortuous path diffusion model is proposed to describe the mass transport of Fc to an electrode surface. Diffusion coefficients are also obtained by pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR), while the values for Fc diffusion are substantially higher than those from electrochemical measurements, suggesting that they measure samples in different ways. The current contributions from each microenvironment indicate that the Fc permeability is much higher in the oil, even though the electron transfer reaction is likely occurring in the surfactant.",0
"The design of high-temperature polymer fuel cells (PEMFCs), e.g. those expected for automotive applications, requires a deep understanding of the electrochemical reactions occurring in the device during operation. Operando electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy can constitute a powerful investigation tool to this aim. At present, however, some strong technical limitations, like low sensitivity to less mobile protons, and the limited temperature range of analysis, have bound its use to case models based on perfluorinated membranes operating at high relative humidity and low temperature. By means of a suitable design of the experimental set-up and the use of a new 3D acquisition protocol, we proved the feasibility of electrochemical NMR microscopy on low-water containing polybenzimidazole-based devices, thus allowing full operando characterization of high-temperature PEMFCs, and also paving the way for applications to other electrochemical devices, such as batteries, sensors, supercapacitors, etc.",0
"The development of improved energy-storage devices, as well as corrosion prevention and metal-electrofinishing technologies, requires knowledge of local composition and transport behaviour in electrolytes near bulk metals, in situ and in real time. It remains a challenge to acquire such data and new analytical methods are required. Recent work shows that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to map concentration gradients and visualise electrochemical processes in electrochemical cells containing bulk metals. This recent work, along with the challenges, and solutions, associated with MRI of these electrochemical cells are reviewed.",8
An immobilized receptor selectively sequesters Li+ and PF6- from aprotic solutions. Subsequent suspension in methanol serves to trigger the release of LiPF6. The recovered LiPF6 has >= 99.5% purity and no appreciable trace metal content as determined by qNMR spectroscopy and ICP-MS analysis.,0
"Among the candidates as negative electrode, silicon is now one of the most attractive alternatives to graphite and has been the subject of many investigations for the past decade. The commercialization of Si electrodes is nevertheless blocked by the inability to overcome the mechanical degradation and electrolyte consumption occurring as a result of the inherent volume expansion upon silicon alloying. The unique combination of their properties renders ionic liquids very attractive and promising candidates to replace the benchmark organic carbonates and could enable an enhanced control of species constituting the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI). In the present study, evolutions of ionic liquid based electrolytes (pure ionic liquid and ionic liquid/carbonate mixes) and the subsequently formed SEI are monitored upon aging and cycling in full Li-ion cells using nonprelithiated silicon electrodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, typically probing the first few nm of the surface of the sample, allowed monitoring of the evolution and possible degradation of the ionic liquid based electrolytes upon aging and cycling of complete Si/NMC batteries. Magic angle spinning NMR combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy is more sensitive to changes occurring in the SEI composition. The degradation of ionic liquid components PYR13 and TFSI is evidenced and their influence on the formation of species at the surface of the silicon electrode clearly observed. However, the presence of the ionic liquid components does not prevent the degradation of carbonates in the parasitic reactions that are consuming the cyclable lithium. Therefore, the failure mechanism scenario is similar to that observed for the full cell using benchmark carbonate electrolytes. Hazard level assessments nevertheless reveal that the addition of ionic liquids is in fact able to moderate the intensity of safety relevant events and improve the cell safety.",0
"A series of glyme-lithium salt ionic liquids were prepared and applied in SO2 absorption. The formed quasi-aza-crown ether fashioned between Li+ and glymes can effectively reduce the solvent volatilization, and have an excellent SO2 absorption capacity. In addition, the mechanism of the interaction between SO2 and ionic liquids was investigated by IR and NMR.",9
"In binary ionic liquid/Li salt mixtures with the novel asymmetric anion FTFSI, electrophoretic mobility (i) values of all ion species were determined using electrophoretic NMR. Li was determined to migrate in negatively charged Li-anion clusters towards the anode. This vehicular transport mechanism was shown to have decreasing relevance at elevated salt concentrations.",9
"Composites of layered structured Birnessite–MnO2 and tunnel structured Hollandite–MnO2 in presence of acetylene black were synthesized as positive electrode materials for rechargeable Mg-ion batteries. Reversible insertion/extraction of Mg-ion in the host structures was examined in the potential range of −1.8 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Results indicated that Mg-ion exchanged Birnessite/acetylene black composite showed the highest discharge capacity (109 mAh g−1) at 1st discharge, when compared to other microstructures of Birnessite. Meanwhile, the composite comprising of 65 wt% Hol–MnO2 and 35 wt% acetylene black showed very high insertion of Mg-ion (0.87 Mg/Mn) corresponding to discharge capacity of 475 mAh g−1 when tested at 60 °C in galvanostatic mode. The layered and tunneled framework of the MnO2 was retained with minor displacive adjustments even after substantial Mg-ion insertion/extraction after several cycles. However, large specific capacity loss was observed after 20 cycles in all of the microstructures probably due to Mg-ion trapping in the host lattice. Furthermore, the effect of the cation (K+) present in the tunnel of Hollandite on Mg-ion diffusion was analyzed as well and it was concluded that tunnel cation could impede the movement of Mg-ion in host structure.",11
"Rechargeable magnesium batteries have attracted wide attention for energy storage. Currently, most studies focus on Mg metal as the anode, but this approach is still limited by the properties of the electrolyte and poor control of the Mg plating/stripping processes. This paper reports the synthesis and application of Bi nanotubes as a high-performance anode material for rechargeable Mg ion batteries. The nanostructured Bi anode delivers a high reversible specific capacity (350 mAh/gBi or 3430 mAh/cm3Bi), excellent stability, and high Coulombic efficiency (95% initial and very close to 100% afterward). The good performance is attributed to the unique properties of in situ formed, interconnected nanoporous bismuth. Such nanostructures can effectively accommodate the large volume change without losing electric contact and significantly reduce diffusion length for Mg2+. Significantly, the nanostructured Bi anode can be used with conventional electrolytes which will open new opportunities to study Mg ion battery chemistry and further improve its properties.",11
"Nanostructured bilayered V2O5 was electrochemically deposited within a carbon nanofoam conductive support. As-prepared electrochemically synthesized bilayered V2O5 incorporates structural water and hydroxyl groups, which effectively stabilizes the interlayers and provides coordinative preference to the Mg2+ cation in reversible cycling. This open-framework electrode shows reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Mg2+ ions in common electrolytes such as acetonitrile. Using a scanning transmission electron microscope we demonstrate that Mg2+ ions can be effectively intercalated into the interlayer spacing of nanostructured V2O5, enabling electrochemical magnesiation against a Mg anode with a specific capacity of 240 mAh/g. We employ HRTEM and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging to understand the role of environment in the intercalation processes. A rebuilt full cell was tested by employing a high-energy ball-milled Sn alloy anode in acetonitrile with Mg(ClO4)2 salt. XRF microscopy reveals effective insertion of Mg ions throughout the V2O5 structure during discharge and removal of Mg ions during electrode charging, in agreement with the electrode capacity. We show using XANES and XRF microscopy that reversible Mg intercalation is limited by the anode capacity.",11
"The need for economical and sustainable energy storage drives battery research today. While Li-ion batteries are the most mature technology, scalable electrochemical energy storage applications benefit from reductions in cost and improved safety. Sodium- and magnesium-ion batteries are two technologies that may prove to be viable alternatives. Both metals are cheaper and more abundant than Li, and have better safety characteristics, while divalent magnesium has the added bonus of passing twice as much charge per atom. On the other hand, both are still emerging fields of research with challenges to overcome. For example, electrodes incorporating Na+ are often pulverized under the repeated strain of shuttling the relatively large ion, while insertion and transport of Mg2+ is often kinetically slow, which stems from larger electrostatic forces. This review provides an overview of cathode and anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, and a comprehensive summary of research on cathodes for magnesium-ion batteries. In addition, several common experimental discrepancies in the literature are addressed, noting the additional constraints placed on magnesium electrochemistry. Lastly, promising strategies for future study are highlighted.",11
"In recent years, there has been significant growth in the demand for secondary batteries, and researchers are increasingly taking an interest in the development of next-generation battery systems. Magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) have been recognized as the optimal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their low cost, superior safety, and environment-friendliness. However, research and development on rechargeable MIBs are still underway as some serious problems need to be resolved. One of the most serious obstacles is the generation of an irreversible passivation layer on the surface of the Mg anode during cycling. In addition to exploring new electrolytes for MIBs, alternative anode materials for MIBs might be an effective solution to this issue. In this review, the composition and working principle of MIBs have been discussed. In addition, recent advances in the area of anode materials (metals and their alloys, metal oxides, and two-dimensional materials) available for MIBs and the corresponding Mg-storage mechanisms have also been summarized. Further, feasible strategies, including structural design, dimension reduction, and introduction of the second phase, have been employed to design high-performance MIB anodes.",11
"Magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) with a Mg-metal negative electrode are expected to combine high energy density and high electromotive force, owing to the divalent ion careers and its low redox potential. However, it has been reported to date that the cell voltage of MIBs is not high enough (∼1.5 V), being far below that of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) (4–5 V). In this work, we have investigated the potentiality of Mg–Co–O and Mg–Ni–O complex oxides as the positive electrode for MIBs, which are composed of these positive electrodes and a Mg negative electrode in acetonitrile with Mg(ClO4)2 salt as an electrolyte. These MIBs can exhibit a relatively high open circuit voltage, OCV, and can light a blue diode after charge. However, as the combination of the acetonitrile electrolyte and metal Mg can yield the passivation on the surface of the Mg electrode, we have also checked these materials for a well-established Li ion battery system, and confirmed that the charged battery can show high OCV. In order to attain such a high cell voltage, it would be significant to exploit the unstabilized ion after charge in the host complex oxide.",11
"Over the last few years, there has been an increased interest in developing safe, next-generation battery systems that offer energy densities higher than those of lithium-based batteries. In this context, batteries based on multivalent-ions (Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) have developed their own niche with their capability to achieve at least twice the energy density of monovalent-ion systems such as Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Among the multivalent-ion battery candidates, magnesium (Mg) batteries appear to be the most viable choice to eventually replace the Li-ion technology because of the high electrode potential, superior safety, and high abundance of Mg-metal. However, the limited development in electrolytes and cathodes has prevented their commercialization to date. There is a lack of suitable electrolytes that can be used at high voltages required for Mg2+ insertion into cathode hosts. The limited compatibility of organic electrolytes with Mg-metal anode is also a challenge, which requires extensive studies of the metal/electrolyte interactions. Such studies over the last two decades were critical in developing state-of-the-art Mg electrolytes that possess voltage windows of >4.0 V and simultaneously be compatible with Mg-metal anodes. Here, we present a review on the development of Mg battery electrolytes, challenges that impede their performance, and promising strategies that have been adopted to address them. We believe that this comprehensive review covering all three categories of Mg electrolytes (liquids, polymers, and solids) would enable researchers to get a quick grasp of the prevailing challenges, and consequently motivate them to develop novel electrolyte candidates.",10
"To initiate wider discussion about promising research directions, this paper highlights a number of challenges in the development of rechargeable Mg batteries, especially those related to the slow solid-state Mg diffusion in common hosts. With a focus on the intercalation mechanism, we compare for the first time different strategies proposed in the literature for developing Mg battery cathodes, like the use of (i) nanoscale cathode materials; (ii) hybrid intercalation compounds containing bound water or other additional anion groups that can presumably screen the charge of the inserted cations, (iii) cluster-containing compounds with efficient attainment of local electroneutrality. This comparative analysis shows that cathodes whose function is based on a combination of the two first strategies, e.g., V2O5 gels and their hybrids, can exhibit relatively high voltage and capacity upon Mg insertion, but their kinetics is insufficiently fast. A proper intercalation mechanism for such materials is still unknown, but their relatively slow cation transport seems to be intrinsic: The paradox is that the high capacity testifies Mg insertion into crystal sites with incomplete charge screening. In contrast, the high rate capability and exclusively stable cycling of cathodes based on Chevrel phases (Mo6-cluster- containing compounds) are appropriate for Mg battery design, but they offer low energy density because of the low voltage. On the basis of the knowledge of the intercalation mechanism in these phases, we believe that the future search for cathode materials in rechargeable Mg batteries should be focused on new cluster-containing intercalation compounds with higher capacity and working potential.",10
"As a next-generation electrochemical energy storage technology, rechargeable magnesium (Mg)-based batteries have attracted wide attention because they possess a high volumetric energy density, low safety concern, and abundant sources in the earth’s crust. While a few reviews have summarized and discussed the advances in both cathode and anode materials, a comprehensive and profound review focusing on the material design strategies that are both representative of and peculiar to the performance improvement of rechargeable Mg-based batteries is rare. In this mini-review, all nine of the material design strategies and approaches to improve Mg-ion storage properties of cathode materials have been comprehensively examined from both internal and external aspects. Material design concepts are especially highlighted, focusing on designing “soft” anion-based materials, intercalating solvated or complex ions, expanding the interlayer of layered cathode materials, doping heteroatoms into crystal lattice, size tailoring, designing metastable-phase materials, and developing organic materials. To achieve a better anode, strategies based on the artificial interlayer design, efficient electrolyte screening, and alternative anodes exploration are also accumulated and analyzed. The strategy advances toward Mg–S and Mg–Se batteries are summarized. The advantages and disadvantages of all-collected material design strategies and approaches are critically discussed from practical application perspectives. This mini-review is expected to provide a clear research clue on how to rationally improve the reliability and feasibility of rechargeable Mg-based batteries and give some insights for the future research of Mg-based batteries as well as other multivalent-ion battery chemistries.",10
"Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical elements in the p-block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge-storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent good solubility in many electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal-sulfur batteries. In this work, the synthetically designed fluorinated porous polymer, when treated with elemental sulfur through a well-known nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (SNAr), allows for the covalent integration of polysulfides into a highly conjugated benzimidazole polymer by replacing the fluorine atoms. Chemically robust benzimidazole linkages allow such harsh post-synthetic treatment and facilitate the electronic activation of the anchored polysulfides for redox reactions under applied potential. The electrode amalgamated with sulfurized polymer mitigates the so-called polysulfide shuttle effect in the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery and also enables a reversible, more environmentally friendly, and more economical aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) battery that is configured with mostly p-block elements as cathode, anode, and electrolytes. The improved cycling stabilities and reduction of the overpotential in both cases pave the way for future sustainable energy storage solutions.Economical sulfur in p-block is valuable for charge storage, but dissolves in electrolytes, limiting battery use. Fluorine-substituted benzimidazole polymer, treated with S8 via SNAr, anchors polysulfides for electrochemical redox-activity. Sulfurized polymer electrodes mitigate polysulfide shuttle in Li-S batteries and enable eco-friendly Al-S batteries. The strategy involves the chemistry of p-block elements such as C, N, S, Al, F, and Cl.image",8
"Amorphous poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-SiO2 composites are prepared by in situ reactions that involve the simultaneous formation of the polymer network and inorganic nanoparticles. The polymer matrix is formed by ultraviolet irradiation of a PEO macromer, and silica is produced in situ by the sol-gel method. The PEO-SiO2 composite mixed with LiBF4 is used as a lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte and electrochemical transport properties such as ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number are measured. A significant increase in the Li+ transference number, up to 0.56, is found together with a slight decrease in the ionic conductivity. The results are interpreted in terms of interactions between the surface OH groups of the inorganic particles, the cations, the anions, and the ether oxygen atoms on the PEO backbone.

"The ion-solvent and ion-ion interactions, oxidative electrochemical stabilities, and ionic mobilities of a series of lithium salt electrolytes with commonly used electrolyte solvents, propylene carbonate (PC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), have been studied using C-13 nuclear magnetric resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and ionic conductivity measurements. The coordinating ability of PC toward lithium salts is significantly higher than that of DMC as shown by the relatively large deshielding of the carbonyl carbon of PC over that of DMC. We have also prepared a novel electrolyte, lithium tetrakis (trifluoromethanesulfonato) gallate [LiGa(OTf)(4)], and investigated its relative binding to PC by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The latter salt showed significant deshielding of the carbonyl carbon of PC compared to the other salts studied, including the conventional LiPF6. However, its conductivity is not enhanced to the same extent and is comparable to that of LiBF4. The CVs show their relative stabilities toward oxidation around 4.5 V and reduction close to lithium potentials. All electrolytes studied here have good electrochemical stability from 0.1 to 5.0 V vs. Li+/Li, and are suitable for applications in lithium-ion cells. (c) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.",16
"Si is a promisinganode material for lithium-ion batteries owingto its high theoretical capacity; however, due to its large volumefluctuation during lithiation/delithiation, significant decay in capacityoccurs during charge-discharge cycling. Therefore, the selectionof appropriate lithiation/delithiation conditions is important tosuppress capacity decay. In this study, the cycling performance ofsilicon-based composite electrodes prepared using a cross-linked polyacrylatebinder was examined at different cutoff voltages, and the degradationof the electrolyte and electrodes was investigated through gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS) and synchrotron radiation X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy. When silicon-graphite (Si-G) electrodeswere examined in a Li cell (with Li metal counter electrode), a rapiddecrease in discharge capacity and Coulombic efficiency was observedat delithiation cutoff voltages of >0.7 V, which was attributedtothe complete consumption of the electrolyte additive, fluoroethylenecarbonate (FEC). After the decrease in FEC content, the main solventsof the electrolyte, such as ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate,underwent electrolyte decomposition reactions and formed co-oligomers.The GC-MS results revealed that the FEC consumption rate increasedwith increasing delithiation cutoff voltage. Furthermore, higher cutoffvoltage leads to oxidative decomposition and elution of the surfacepassivation film formed at the electrode surface because of the exposureto high voltage. FEC consumption was insignificant in the Si-G//LiFePO4 Li-ion cell (without Li metal in the cell), indicating thatLi metal plating/stripping also consumed the FEC additive. The findingsof this study can be used to gain insights into the degradation mechanismsof Si-based electrodes and can therefore act as a basis for researchand development of Si-based electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.",0
"The dissolution of transition metal ions from positive electrodes and loss of (both electroactive and transport) Li+ ions seriously impair the durability of lithium ion batteries. We show herein that the improvement in the cycle life of lithium manganate spinel-graphite cells effected by multifunctional separators results from smaller interfacial resistances at both positive and negative electrodes, that can in turn be traced back to thinner, more uniform, and chemically different surface films, due to lessened parasitic reactions and a decreased accumulation of parasitic reaction products at electrode surfaces, as evidenced by HR-SEM, FIB-SEM, EDX, F-19 MAS NMR, and ICP-OES data.",0
"MgMnSiO4 is a promising cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries, however, it still suffers from unsatisfactory electrochemical performances. Although the modulation of electrolyte formulation and cell configuration are critical to enhancing the electrochemical behavior of MgMnSiO4, few works focused on these important issues. Therefore, to get cathode materials operating at high voltage and overcome the electrostatics problems of bivalent Mg2+ ion, we adopt an unconventional approach of engaging water in a conventional nonaqueous solution such as 0.5 M Mg(TFSI)(2) in DME (dimethoxyethane). The electrochemical reaction of Mg/electrolyte/C@MgMnSiO4 cell occurs at 2.8 - 0.5 V (vs. Mg2+/Mg) with 160 mA h g(-1) entailing 300 W h kg(-1) at the materials' level. The results show that C@MgMnSiO4 could be a potential cathode material for high-energy magnesium secondary batteries in a bifunctional electrolytes, which not just utilized as a transmitter ... of Mg2+, but also as a source of H+ . We prove that the generated H+ increases the isotropy around Mg2+, changes in the Mn oxidation states, and modifies Mg/MgO interphase. Eventually, by assembling several Mg-ion full cells versus different anodes including Li4Ti5O12, activated carbon, and Mg0.5MnSiO4, we recall the main challenges to overcome. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

"A novel dimeric ionic liquid based on imidazolium cation and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI) anion has been synthesized through a metathesis reaction. its chemical shift values and thermal properties are identified via I H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

"Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with profound compatibility for high-voltage cathodes and reliable operation over a board temperature range are in urgent demand for the practical application of solid lithium metal batteries (SLMBs). In this study, a SPE containing interconnected fast Li+ conducting network was constructed via an in-situ hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) within polyacrylonitrile (PAN) matrix to intensify the thermal stability of SLMBs. The in-situ formed interconnected inorganic network not only acts as a robust backbone for the whole SPE, but also furnishes sufficient continuous surfaces with Lewis-acidic sites, which will promote the dissociation of Li salt. As a consequence, the fabricated SPE exhibits an promising ionic conductivity of similar to 0.35 mS cm(-1), an attractive Young' modulus of 8.627 Gpa and a satisfactory lithium-ion transference number of 0.52. Solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance (S-NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used to unravel the interactions among Li+ ions, PAN and as-formed SiO2. Based on the in-situ formed SPE, a Li/LiFePO4 SLMB presents an excellent cycle stability from 20 to 80 degrees C and a Li/LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 SLMB shows a steady discharge capacity of 173.1 mAh g(-1) with 93.8 % retention after 200 cycles at 4.3 V. Additionally, the Li/LiFePO4 pouch cell also delivers a stable cyclability and superior safety for practical applications.

"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) containing silicon negative electrodes have been the subject of much recent investigation because of the extremely large gravimetric and volumetric capacity of silicon. The crystalline-to-amorphous phase transition that occurs on electrochemical Li insertion into crystalline Si, during the first discharge, hinders attempts to link structure in these systems with electrochemical performance. We apply a combination of static, in situ and magic angle sample spinning, ex Situ 7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies to investigate the changes in local structure that occur in an actual working LIB. The first discharge occurs via the formation of isolated Si atoms and smaller Si-Si clusters embedded in a Li matrix; the latter are broken apart at the end of the discharge, forming isolated Si atoms. A spontaneous reaction of-the lithium silicide with the electrolyte is directly observed in the in situ NMR experiments; this mechanism results in self-discharge and potential capacity loss. The rate of this self-discharge process is much slower when CIVIC (carboxymethylcellulose) is used as the binder.",0
"Electrolyte chemistries, including the composition of chemical species and their transformation processes, are of utmost importance for safe and stable operation of any battery, but the corresponding understanding remains incomplete. Prevalent viewpoints on direct solvation are not satisfactory sometimes in describing the implicit relationship among solvents, active ionic species and electrode/electrolyte interphases. Here we report the synergy between the coordination and trace ionization of amine/ether co-solvents to enable a reversible magnesium (Mg)-metal anode for low cost rechargeable Mg batteries. Unique bivalent [Mg(amino)6]2+ is firstly identified as the active ionic species via single-crystal X-ray diffraction, mass spectroscopy, and NMR tests. Partially protonated alkylamine/ether cations, formed due to trace solvent ionization, can chemically associate with the trifluoromethanesulfonimide (TFSI) anion to form neutrally charged ion pairs, mitigating the decomposition of the TFSI anion on the Mg-metal anode. Cryo-electron microscopy images along with the deuterium-oxide (D2O) titration tests reveal a much thin electrolyte-anode interface and one distinctive component of MgH2 in electrodeposits, closely related to the ionization process of co-solvents. A much better Mg plating/stripping reversibility (an overpotential of similar to 0.10 V vs. similar to 2.0 V for the pristine electrolyte) and prolonged cycle life (similar to 320 h vs. similar to 38 h for the pristine electrolyte) are achieved by regulating the coordination/ionization processes of co-solvents.The synergy between coordination and trace ionization induces active ionic species formation and simultaneously alleviates electrolyte decomposition.",1
"The near ambient pressure photoemission (NAPP) technique equipped with a liquid jet (LJ) is used for the first time to explore the electronic structure of the most commonly employed carbonate based Li-ion battery electrolytes. Experiments were performed at the SIM beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) with the purpose of monitoring the Li-ion (Li+, Li 1s) solvation of 1M LiClO4 in 1:1 EC:DMC, both anhydrous and with the addition of 5 % H2O, and in DMSO. These electrolytes have high vapor pressures that prevent their study by traditional XPS and therefore necessitate the use of NAPP. Our measurements show differences in binding energies between the Cl 2p and Li 1s core levels (Delta E = Cl 2p(3/2)-Li 1s) between different solvents, in particularly between the EC:DMC and the DMSO. The addition of only 5 % H2O clearly influences the electronic structure in DMC:EC, but to a lesser extent than completely changing the solvent. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of solvated Li+ structures within the solvent-separated ion pair (SSIP) model provide support to our experimental findings by revealing that the observed Delta E between solvents is directly related to the change in the electronic structure of the Li+ cation and ClO4 (-) anion due to the modification of the solvation shell. This study establishes LJ NAPP as a powerful analytical method for the study of Li+ solvation that will prove complementary to the more established approaches of FTIR and NMR, but at the same time will allow for new experiments that cannot yet be realized by FTIR and NMR.",0
"Alluaudite phases are very attractive as both cathode and electrolyte materials for rechargeable sodiumion batteries. In this work, the combined experimental and DFT studies have been performed to establish the diffusion mechanism in alluaudite-like compound Na5In(MoO4)(4). The ionic conductivity was found to reach 3.3 x 10(-4) S/cm at 687 K, with an activation energy of 0.66 eV. The sodium diffusion mechanisms have been revealed from the analysis of the Na-23 NMR spectra along with the DFT estimations of Naion migration barriers. Our results predict that one-dimensional diffusion of sodium in the separate channels along the c-axis is accompanied by the cross-linking jumps providing two-dimensional diffusion in the bc-plane. It is clearly demonstrated that the indium deficiency favors 2D diffusion, but sharply increases the energy barrier for 1D diffusion. Comparison of our results for Na5In(MoO4)(4) and related Na5Sc(MoO4)(4) shows that the type and deficiency of M-metal in the NaxMy(MoO4)(x) alluaudites can control the sodium diffusion. The present work highlights the key aspects of cation influence on the diffusion properties in alluaudite materials.",10
"Ionic liquids (Ls) are promising electrolyte materials for developing next-generation rechargeable batteries. In order to improve their properties, several kinds of additives have been investigated. In this study, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was chosen as a new additive in IL electrolytes because it can form an inclusion complex with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (TFSA) anions. We prepared the composites by mixing N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfony)amide/LiTFSA and a given amount of triacetyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Ac beta-CD). The thermal behaviors and electrochemical properties of the composites were analyzed by several techniques. In addition, pulse field gradient NMR measurements were conducted to determine the self- diffusion coefficients of the component ions. The addition of Ac beta-CD to the IL electrolytes results in the decrease in the conductivity value and the increase in the viscosity value. In contrast, the addition of Ac beta-CD to the IL electrolytes induced an improvement in the anodic stability because of the formation of an inclusion complex between the Ac beta-CD and TFSA anions. CDs are potential candidates as additives in IL electrolytes for electrochemical applications.",0
"Current performances of Li-, Na-, or K-ion batteries are mainly limited by the specific capacity of the positive electrode. Therefore, it is important to reach the highest capacity possible for a given electrode material. Here, we investigate the performance limitation of KVPO4F, a prospective material for K-ion batteries, which can deliver only 80% of its theoretical capacity. We discover that the capacity limitation of KVPO4F is related to a kinetic competition between K+ deinsertion and side reactions ascribed to the electrolyte degradation at high potentials. Homeotypic VPO4F can be obtained from KVPO4F through a chemical deintercalation process, which disproves a possible structural limitation or instability. The deintercalated compound was characterized by electron and X-ray diffraction, Xray absorption spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Despite the structural stability, a spontaneous reaction occurs between the deintercalated KxVPO4F (x < 0.5) and the electrolyte (0.8 M KPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate), with an electron transfer to vanadium compensated by K+ intercalation. This reaction leads to self-discharge until the open circuit potential is lower than 4.7 V versus K+/K, corresponding to the K0.5VPO4F composition.",8
"An anatase nanotube array has been prepared with a special morphology: two concentric walls and a very small central cavity. The method used here to achieve the double-wall structure is a single-step anodization process under a voltage ramp. Thanks to this nanostructure, which is equivalent to a fractal electrode, the electrochemical behaviour is improved, and the specific capacity is higher in both lithium and sodium cells due to pseudocapacitance. The double-wall structure of the nanotube enhances the surface of TiO2 being in contact with the electrolyte solution, thus allowing an easy penetration of the alkali ions into the electrode active material. The occurrence of sodium titanate in the electrode material after electrochemical reaction with sodium is studied by using EPR, HRTEM and NMR experiments.",0
"Silicon-graphite electrodes usually experience an increase in cycling performance by the addition of graphite, however, the relation of the silicon/graphite ratio and the aging mechanisms of the individual electrode and electrolyte compounds still requires a more fundamental understanding. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to understand and quantify the degradation phenomena in silicon-graphite electrodes with silicon contents between 20-60 wt%. By evaluating the cycling performance and total irreversible capacity of silicon-graphite electrodes vs. capacitively oversized LiFePO4 electrodes in presence of a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)-containing electrolyte, we demonstrate that the aging of silicon-based electrodes can be distinguished into two distinct phenomena, which we describe as silicon particle degradation and electrode degradation. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and a detailed analysis of the electrode polarization upon cycling complement our discussion. Further, we deploy post-mortem F-19-NMR spectroscopy to (i) quantify to loss of moles of FEC in the electrolyte and correlate this with the amount of charge that was exchanged by the silicon-graphite electrodes, (ii) estimate the pore volume of the silicon-graphite electrodes that is occupied by FEC decomposition products, and (iii) derive implications for the relation of the electrolyte volume and cycle life of commercial silicon-based Li-ion batteries.

"Conversion materials based on metal fluorides offer enhanced charge capacity as positive electrodes in Li-ion electrochemical cells. However, to date, little is understood about the interactions these structurally dynamic materials have with nonaqueous electrolytes during both lithiation and delithiation. Such interactions are explored using bismuth (III) fluoride. This work details the evolution of the electrolyte decomposition products at both highly oxidizing potentials (4.5 V vs. Li/Li+) and during delithiation of the positive electrode after having formed a decomposition layer via electrochemical reduction of the electrolyte solvents. For the first time, the impact of the electrolyte reactions on the surface and subsurface chemistry of the inorganic conversion material is explored. Observed results offer an explanation for the direct influence of electrolyte choice on cycling efficiency of metal fluoride conversion materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",15
"We studied a lithium-ion conducting polymer based on sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (LiTFSI). Self-standing membranes were prepared by the solvent-casting technique with a LiTFSI loading of 0 to 30 wt.-%. The thermogravimetric analysis curves showed that the SO3H groups decompose earlier in the SPEEK-LiTFSI membranes than in pure SPEEK, owing to interactions between the Li+ ions and the SO3H groups. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry studies showed that the addition of LiTFSI decreased the crystallinity and the glass-transition temperature of the polymer, which revealed the plasticizing effect of the lithium salt on the polymer matrix. The Li-7 NMR spectroscopy results showed a single central transition line at around delta = -1.2 ppm, which indicated the presence of free mobile lithium ions. Dynamic mechanical analysis of the membrane showed it to be mechanically stable up to 100 degrees C, a prerequisite for flexible lithium polymer batteries. The highest room-temperature conductivity in the order of 10(-5) Scm(-1) was observed for the 20 wt.-% LiTFSI-doped SPEEK membrane, which increased to 5 x 10(-4) Scm(-1) at 100 degrees C.",0
"Polymer blends of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were prepared with different molar ratios by a solvent-casting technique. The XRD patterns of the blends show that the degree of crystallinity of the PVA membranes decreases with the addition of PAA owing to the formation of interpenetrating polymer chains. The vibrational spectra of the blend membranes reveal the formation of strong hydrogen bonding between PVA and PAA. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) reveals that the storage modulus of a 25 mol-% PAA sample is comparable to that of pure PVA and, therefore, confirms the mechanical stability of the blend membranes. Significant changes in the peak areas and chemical shifts of the PVA hydroxyl signal ( = 4-5 ppm) in the H-1 NMR spectra of the blend membranes confirm the strong hydrogen bonding between the OH groups of PVA and PAA. The ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI) with 0.2 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) was added to the polymer blend to prepare flexible, nonvolatile hybrid polymer electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries. A maximum ionic conductivity of 1 mScm(-1) is observed at 90 degrees C for the membrane with 70 mol-% IL.",0
"The extreme fast charging (XFC) capability of graphiteanodes isbecoming increasingly important with the development of electric vehiclesdue to the usage and safety requirement. In this work, the XFC performanceof the graphite anodes is improved by simply adding fluoroethylenecarbonate (FEC) into the electrolyte. This robust system is studiedby in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagneticresonance (EPR) experiments to unravel the kinetic mechanism. TheLi local environments in the graphite are detected by in situ NMR,which reveals the phase transitions during XFC without and with theFEC additive and the corresponding Li-ion mobility. The graphite conductivityvariation is estimated by in situ EPR, and the plated Li can be clearlyobserved in the later period of XFC. The kinetics of graphite lithiationis deduced to be surface-controlled during the dilute stages and bulk-controlledduring the dense stages. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formedwith FEC is more homogeneous and richer in LiF, which delivers a fasterLi(+) transport ability and results in the improvement ofthe surface kinetics. The major advantage of FEC additive is in theoptimization of the Li plating behavior. Without FEC, the Li depositsgrow locally, while the FEC additive consumes more currents to formthe SEI and facilitate the uniform deposition of metallic Li on graphiteduring XFC. These results display the versatility of in situ NMR andEPR technologies in the research of XFC kinetics.",16

"A new kind of Al-ion battery with carbon paper as the cathode, high-purity Al foil as the anode and ionic liquid as the electrolyte is proposed in this work. The significance of the presented battery is going to be an extremely high average voltage plateau of ca. 1.8 V vs. Al3+/Al.",5
"Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal element in earth crust, together with low cost and high safety. Al-ion batteries (AIBs) have been regarded as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in large scale applications and attracted much attention in current days. In this review, recent developments of AIBs including the electrolyte exploration, electrode design and Al protection are summarized. Both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes exhibit important benefits for AIBs, especially ionic liquid electrolytes with high stripping/plating efficiency, which are preferentially discussed here. Furthermore, we highlight the design principles and electrochemical mechanism for carbons, metal compounds as well as new-type positive electrode materials for high-performance AIBs. Besides, we focus on the negative electrode protection with suitable coating layers to reduce dendrite formation and improve electrochemical activation of Al negative electrodes. The accessible characterization techniques that promote the development of AIBs are discussed. Finally, prospects and outlooks of AIBs towards theoretical investigations and practical applications are provided.",5
"The development of new rechargeable battery systems could fuel various energy applications, from personal electronics to grid storage1,2. Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high capacity3. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration4, low cell discharge voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge voltage plateaus (1.1–0.2 volts6 or 1.8–0.8 volts7) and insufficient cycle life (less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26–85 per cent over 100 cycles)4,5,6,7. Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g–1 and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around one minute with a current density of ~4,000 mA g–1 (equivalent to ~3,000 W kg–1), and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.",5
"The expansion of renewable energy and the growing number of electric vehicles and mobile devices are demanding improved and low-cost electrochemical energy storage. In order to meet the future needs for energy storage, novel material systems with high energy densities, readily available raw materials, and safety are required. Currently, lithium and lead mainly dominate the battery market, but apart from cobalt and phosphorous, lithium may show substantial supply challenges prospectively, as well. Therefore, the search for new chemistries will become increasingly important in the future, to diversify battery technologies. But which materials seem promising? Using a selection algorithm for the evaluation of suitable materials, the concept of a rechargeable, high-valent all-solid-state aluminum-ion battery appears promising, in which metallic aluminum is used as the negative electrode. On the one hand, this offers the advantage of a volumetric capacity four times higher (theoretically) compared to lithium analog. On the other hand, aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust. There is a mature industry and recycling infrastructure, making aluminum very cost efficient. This would make the aluminum-ion battery an important contribution to the energy transition process, which has already started globally. So far, it has not been possible to exploit this technological potential, as suitable positive electrodes and electrolyte materials are still lacking. The discovery of inorganic materials with high aluminum-ion mobility—usable as solid electrolytes or intercalation electrodes—is an innovative and required leap forward in the field of rechargeable high-valent ion batteries. In this review article, the constraints for a sustainable and seminal battery chemistry are described, and we present an assessment of the chemical elements in terms of negative electrodes, comprehensively motivate utilizing aluminum, categorize the aluminum battery field, critically review the existing positive electrodes and solid electrolytes, present a promising path for the accelerated development of novel materials and address problems of scientific communication in this field.",5
"Contrary to early motivation, the majority of aluminium ion batteries developed to date do not utilise multivalent ion storage; rather, these batteries rely on monovalent complex ions for their main redox reaction. This limitation is somewhat frustrating because the innate advantages of metallic aluminium such as its low cost and high air stability cannot be fully taken advantage of. Here, we report a tetradiketone macrocycle as an aluminium ion battery cathode material that reversibly reacts with divalent (AlCl2+) ions and consequently achieves a high specific capacity of 350 mAh g−1 along with a lifetime of 8000 cycles. The preferred storage of divalent ions over their competing monovalent counterparts can be explained by the relatively unstable discharge state when using monovalent AlCl2+ ions, which exert a moderate resonance effect to stabilise the structure. This study opens an avenue to realise truly multivalent aluminium ion batteries based on organic active materials, by tuning the relative stability of discharged states with carrier ions of different valence states.",5
"Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost-effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, understanding the energy-storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study is to investigate AlCl4− ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high-energy-storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that a multi-ion transport mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical behavior of the battery. The lattice distortion of CoSe2 caused by AlCl4− ion intercalation, has a considerable effect on the initial stability of the battery. MXene as a support material reduces the size of CoSe2 growing on its surface, effectively inhibiting the lattice distortion caused by the interaction with the aluminum-anion complex, thus addressing the issues of poor reversibility, cycle instability, and low Coulombic efficiency of the battery. Hence, understanding the impact of MXene on the battery may aid in further improving the design of electrode materials.",5
"Recently, interest in aluminium ion batteries with aluminium anodes, graphite cathodes and ionic liquid electrolytes has increased; however, much remains to be done to increase the cathode capacity and to understand details of the anion–graphite intercalation mechanism. Here, an aluminium ion battery cell made using pristine natural graphite flakes achieves a specific capacity of ∼110 mAh g−1 with Coulombic efficiency ∼98%, at a current density of 99 mA g−1 (0.9 C) with clear discharge voltage plateaus (2.25–2.0 V and 1.9–1.5 V). The cell has a capacity of 60 mAh g−1 at 6 C, over 6,000 cycles with Coulombic efficiency ∼ 99%. Raman spectroscopy shows two different intercalation processes involving chloroaluminate anions at the two discharging plateaus, while C–Cl bonding on the surface, or edges of natural graphite, is found using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Finally, theoretical calculations are employed to investigate the intercalation behaviour of choloraluminate anions in the graphite electrode.",5
"Silicides are attractive novel active materials for use in the negative-electrodes of next-generation lithium-ion batteries that use certain ionic-liquid electrolytes; however, the reaction mechanism of the above combination is yet to be clarified. Possible reactions at the silicide electrode are as follows: deposition and dissolution of Li metal on the electrode, lithiation and delithiation of Si, which would result from the phase separation of the silicide, and alloying and dealloying of the silicide with Li. Herein, we examined these possibilities using various analysis methods. The results revealed that the lithiation and delithiation of silicide occurred.",11
"This work aims to study the influences of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid incorporation with various weight percentage to the characteristics of biopolymer blend electrolytes (BBEs) based on methyl cellulose/carboxymethyl cellulose (MC/CMC) (50/50) blend, i.e., the ionic conductivities, crystallinities, mechanical properties, surface morphology, and thermal stability. [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid is synthesized using a metathesis reaction between [EMIm]Br and CH3COOK in methanol solvent, while the BBEs preparation is conducted using casting solution technique. The functional groups and molecular structure of BBEs samples are confirmed by using Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonce (NMR), while the characteristics of ionic conductivities, mechanical properties, crystallinities, surface morphology, and stability thermal are conducted using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, tensile tester, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry analysis/differential thermogravimetry (TGA/DTG). The [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid incorporation greatly affects the characteristics of BBEs with optimum condition at the 15% [EMIm]Ac ionic liquid incorporation with a value of 1.53 x 10(-2) S cm(-1), 20.83 MPa/21.57%, and 217.24-356.34 celcius for ionic conductivity, tensile strength/elongation at break, and decomposition temperature, respectively. The optimum condition from this study fulfills the standard minimum requirement for a lithium-ion battery separator.",15
"The global energy demand calls for more efficient storage systems. In this review, the state of the art of Li/air and Li/O2 batteries is discussed with particular attention on the more recent findings regarding all the battery compartments. Both aqueous and non-aqueous systems are considered, and the most critical issues for better battery design are addressed. Whereas the predicted charge/discharge values for these devices do justify the intense research efforts performed nowadays, great problems are still present which must be overcome in order to make Li/air and Li/O2 a reality for future large-scale applications.",3
"A Li-air battery could potentially provide three to five times higher energy density/specific energy than conventional batteries and, thus, enable the driving range of an electric vehicle to be comparable to gasoline vehicles. However, making Li-air batteries rechargeable presents significant challenges, mostly related to the materials. Here, the key factors that influence the rechargeability of Li-air batteries are discussed with a focus on nonaqueous systems. The status and materials challenges for nonaqueous rechargeable Li-air batteries are reviewed. These include electrolytes, cathode (electrocatalysts), lithium metal anodes, and oxygen-selective membranes (oxygen supply from air). A perspective for the future of rechargeable Li-air batteries is provided.",3
"A review is presented of the present state-of-the-art of Li-air cells and batteries. Weexamine the properties of this unique system in terms of the effects of solubilities of reac-tants and products in both nonaqueous (aprotic) and aqueous electrolyte solutions. Definitetrends are observed, such as increasing cell-specific energy and capacity as both the oxygensolubility increases and viscosity decreases in organic solvents, but quantitative analyses arelimited owing to the complex relations between solubility, solution viscosity, oxygen diffu-sion, and electrolytic conductivity. Adding to this complex relation is the dependence of thenature of the carbon-based air cathode (surface area and pore volume) upon practical specificcapacities, which can be realized with Li-air cells that far exceed the specific energies andcapacities of all present commercial metal-air and Li-ion cells and batteries",3
"Lithium-air batteries have become a focus of research on future battery technologies. Technical issues associated with lithium-air batteries, however, are rather complex. Apart from the sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics which demand efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, issues are also inherited from the nature of an open battery system and the use of reactive metal lithium as anode. Lithium-air batteries, which exchange oxygen directly with ambient air, face more challenges due to the additional oxidative agents of moisture, carbon dioxide, etc. which degrade the metal lithium anode, deteriorating the performance of the batteries. In order to improve the cycling performance one must hold a full picture of lithium-oxygen electrochemistry in the presence of carbon dioxide and/or moisture and fully understand the fundamentals of chemistry reactions therein. Recent advances in the exploration of the effect of moisture and CO2 contaminants on Li-O2 batteries are reviewed, and the mechanistic understanding of discharge/charge process in O2 at controlled level of moisture and/or CO2 are illustrated. Prospects for development opportunities of Li-air batteries, insight into future research directions, and guidelines for the further development of rechargeable Li-air batteries are also given.",3
"The rechargeable lithium–air battery has the highest theoretical specific energy of any rechargeable battery and could transform energy storage if a practical device could be realized. At the fundamental level, little was known about the reactions and processes that take place in the battery, representing a significant barrier to progress. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the chemistry and electrochemistry that govern the operation of the lithium–air battery, especially the reactions at the cathode. The mechanisms of O2 reduction to Li2O2 on discharge and the reverse process on charge are discussed in detail, as are their consequences for the rate and capacity of the battery. The various parasitic reactions involving the cathode and electrolyte during discharge and charge are also considered. We also provide views on understanding the stability of the cathode and electrolyte and examine design principles for better lithium–air batteries.",3
