"The effects of carbon microstructure and loading on the performance of Li/air batteries were investigated. We found that the capacities of Li/air batteries were related to both the specific capacity per unit weight of the carbon source  and the carbon locating per unit area . Therefore, the product of these two parameters [i.e., the area-specific capacity ] was introduced to optimize the performance of the air electrode. At the fixed electrolyte amount , the best area-specific capacity of  was obtained at a carbon loading of . Further increase or decrease in the carbon loading led to a reduced area-specific capacity. The capacities of air electrodes increased with increasing mesopore volumes of the carbon sources. The uniformity of the pore sizes also played an important role in determining the electrochemical performances of the Li/air batteries. At fixed carbon loading and discharge rates, the capacity increased significantly with increasing electrolyte amounts. This phenomenon was explained by the formation of extra triphase regions in the air electrodes. After optimizing the electrode and electrolyte parameters, a high capacity of  carbon was obtained for Li/air batteries operated in ambient oxygen pressure (0.21 atm).",3
"Interfacial stability is considered as a priority in high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs), stemming from the extremely low electrochemical potential of Li metal and its intrinsic high reactivity. The naturally grown solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing organic compositions (e.g., R1OCOOR2, ROLi) and inorganic compositions (e.g., Li2CO3, Li3N) is thermodynamically unstable against Li metal. Herein, we created a highly stable organic interphase (HSOI) with a well-tuned LUMO energy to improve the antireduction ability of SEI components and enhance the long-term cyclability of LMBs. Employing trifluoromethyl functional groups (-CF3) in the molecule structure of a SEI can significantly tune the orbital energies and the HOMO-LUMO gap due to the strong electron-withdrawing property of -CF3 functional groups. With the protection of HSOI, cells can cycle more than 1300 h, which is 5-fold improvement in cell lifetime, demonstrating the vital role of the HSOI layer on the stability of LMBs.",8
"Cycling lithiated metal oxides to high potential (>4.5 V vs Li) is of significant interest for the next generation of lithium ion batteries as this significantly increases the capacity and energy of cells. However, cells cycled to high potential suffer from rapid capacity fade due to a combination of thickening of the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and impedance growth on the cathode. While transition metal catalysed degradation of the anode SEI has been widely proposed as a primary source of capacity loss, a related acid induced degradation of the anode SEI is proposed. A systematic investigation of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes cycled to 4.2 and 4.6 V has been conducted and the oxidative generation of the strong acid difluorophosphoric acid (F2PO2H) has been quantified by solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Ex-situ surface analysis of the electrodes with X-ray Photo Electron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests that the generation of F2PO2H correlates with a thickening of the anode SEI and an increase in the fluorophosphate content of the SEI. Changes to the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 surface for cells cycled to 4.6 V are also consistent with the generation of acidic species. There is good correlation between the concentration F2PO2H, anode SEI degradation and the capacity loss of the cells.",0
"As part of studies for finding active materials in the redox-flow battery system using ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolyte, we have synthesized [Fe(L)(x)][Tf2N](2) (L = 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), or 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine (terpy); Tf2N = bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, x = 3 for bpy and phen; 2 for terpy), and examined their electrochemical properties in [BMI][Tf2N] (BMI = 1-butyl-3-nnethylimidazolium). From H-1-NMR and UV-vis absorption spectra, it was confirmed that three Fe(II) species exist as [Fe(L)(x)](2+) in [BMI][Tf2N] solution. Cyclic voltammogranns (CVs) and chronoamperograms (CAs) of the [Fe(L)(x)](2+) species in [BMI][Tf2N] solution were measured at 25 degrees C. In the CVs, two peaks corresponding to the redox couples of Fe(II)/Fe(III) were observed around 1V vs. Ag/AgCl, and their redox reactions were found to be quasi-reversible. The diffusion coefficients of [Fe(L)(x)](2+) were estimated to be (3-9) x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) by chronoamperometry. The standard rate constants for the redox reactions were estimated to be (2-6) x 10(-3) cm s(-1) at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, the present Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox systems were found to be cycled stably. From these results, the [Fe(L)(x)](2+) species are expected to be used as cathode active materials for the redox-flow batteries using [BMI][Tf2N] as the electrolyte.

"A synthesis route for preparing highly conductive solid organic-inorganic hybrid electrolytes has been developed by using cyanuric chloride as the coupling core to react with diamino-terminated poly(oxyalkylene) triblock copolymers, followed by cross-linking with an epoxy alkoxysilane 3-glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane via a sol-gel process The present hybrid electrolyte with a [O]/[Li] I ratio of 32 was found to be the most conductive, reaching a maximum lithium ion conductivity of 6.8 x 10(-5) Scm(-1) at 30 degrees C The Li-ion mobility was determined from Li-7 static NMR line width measurements and correlated with their ionic conductivities. The onset of Li-7 line narrowing was closely related to the T-g of the hybrid electrolytes as measured by DSC experiments Thus, the motions of the lithium cations are strongly coupled with the segmental motion of the polymer chains, which is in line with the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher behavior as observed in ionic conductivity (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Hyperbranched poly(glycidol) (HPG) containing hydroxyl groups is firstly synthesized via anionic polymerization, and then reacts with thionyl chloride to form chlorine end-terminated hyperbranched poly(glycidol) (HPG-Cl). Different ionic liquid polymers are synthesized from the reaction of HPG-Cl with N-methylimidazole and then anion exchange with hexafluorophosphoric acid and sodium tetrafluoroborate. The structure and properties of the obtained ionic liquid polymers are characterized by H-1 NMR, ATR-FTIR, DSC and TGA, respectively. Ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes composed of ionic liquid polymer and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (LITFSI) is investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the ionic conductivity of the prepared ionic liquid polymer electrolyte can reach 3.5 x 10(-4) Scm(-1) at 30 A degrees C when the weight ratio of ionic liquid polymer ([HPG-MeIm]BF4) to lithium salt (LiTFSI) is 4.5.",9
"Lithium-sulfur batteries are among the most promising nextgeneration battery systems due to the high capacity of sulfur as cathodic material. Beyond its interesting intrinsic properties, sulfur possesses a very low conductivity and complex electrochemistry, which involves the high solubility of the lithium sulfides in the electrolyte. These two characteristics are at the core of a series of limitations of its performance as active cathode material, which leads to batteries with low cyclability. Recently, inverse vulcanized sulfur was shown to retain capacity far better than elemental sulfur, leading to batteries with excellent cyclability. Nevertheless, the diene co-monomers used so far in the inverse vulcanization process are man-made molecules. Herein, a tentative work on exploring inverse vulcaniza-tion using two naturally available monomers, diallyl sulfide and myrcene, is presented. The inverse vulcanization of sulfur was successfully completed, and the resulting polymers were characterized by FTIR, NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Afterwards these polymers were tested as cathodic materials in lithium-sulfur cells. The sulfur-natural dienes materials exhibited high capacity at different C rates and high lifetime over 200 cycles with very high capacity retention at a moderate C rate of C/5. Altogether, these materials made from inexpensive and abundant chemicals are an excellent option as sustainable materials for electrochemical energy storage.",0
"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and complex impedance spectroscopy have been used to study the polymer gel electrolytes formed by amylopectin rich starch, plasticized with glycerol and containing lithium perchlorate. The use of plasticizer enhances the conductivity, which reaches similar to 10(-4) S/cm at room temperature. The Li-7 NMR decoupling experiments performed at 183 K show that 80% of the sub-T-g linewidth is attributable to the heteronuclear Li-H interaction, suggesting a weaker Li - polymer interaction in the plasticized electrolyte when compared with the unplasticized ones. The Li-7 NMR results exhibit the qualitative features associated with the lithium mobility in the polymer gel electrolyte, namely the presence of a well defined Li-7 spin-lattice relaxation maxima at 340 K.",0
"A whole series of lithium borophosphate glasses of composition 45 Li2O-55 [x B2O3-(1 - x) P2O5], 0 <= 1x <= 1 was prepared for the first time, thanks to the use of the twin roller quenching technique. As their more popular sodium counterparts, these glasses exhibit a mixed glass former effect with non linear increase in both glass transition temperature and conductivity when phosphorous is replaced by boron. A fairly good conductivity (similar to 2 x 10(-7) Omega(-1).cm(-1) at room temperature) coupled to a high T-g (similar to 450 degrees C) makes these glasses interesting as solid electrolytes for the development of thin-film batteries. A structural investigation was carried out both by Raman spectroscopy and for the first time, by B-11 NMR at high field, 18.8 T. Raman spectra showed the signature of many types of vibrations indicating the presence of a large variety of entities in the glasses. B-11 NMR at 18.8 T helped in separating the resonances of three-coordinated and four-coordinated boron species and counting them by direct integration. On the whole it was shown that while the T-g evolution relied upon the presence of mixed borophosphate entities, the conductivity was directly linked to the presence of BO4 entities alone irrespective of their specific environment.

"A novel ionic liquid (IL) (1-octyl-3-propyl-1H-imidazole-3-ium iodide) was synthesized and used as a corrosion inhibitor for battery electrodes in 34% H2SO4 solution because IL compounds have high ionic conductivity and superior adsorption capabilities. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy were used to identify the novel IL. According to electrochemical measure-ments, IL molecules adsorption on the electrode surface of the battery increased the charge transfer resistance, which in turn enhanced the inhibition efficiency, which reached 91.64% in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and 87.70% in the electrochemical frequency modulation (EFM) technique. The adsorption of IL molecules on the surface of the battery electrode is demonstrated by several surface morphology in-vestigations. The battery tests were performed using Pb-Ca alloy as the working electrode. Results of the tests indicated an increase in both electrical capacity efficiencies from 84.66 to 97% and reserve capacity from 50 to 60 min. Thus, this IL compound can improve the battery performance if used as an electrolyte additive.",0
"Two binary mixed solvent systems typically used for lithium batteries were studied by measuring the self-diffusion coefficients of the solvent, lithium ion and anion, independently by using the multi-nuclear pulsed field-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) H-1, Li-7 and F-19 NMR method. One system was propylene carbonate (PC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) system and the other binary system was PC and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and the lithium salt used was LiN(SO2CF3)2 (LiTFSI). The relative ratio of the PC was changed from zero (pure DME and DEC) to 100% (pure PC) in the DME-PC and the DEC-PC systems, respectively. The self-diffusion coefficients of the solvents were measured with and without the lithium salt, and the two solvents had almost the same diffusion coefficient in the DEC-PC system, while DME diffused faster than PC in the DME-PC system. In the electrolytes the solvents diffused the fastest, followed by the anion with the lithium ion diffusing the slowest. The degree of ion dissociation was estimated for each electrolyte by comparing the ionic conductivities estimated from the ion diffusion and those measured directly by the electrochemical method.

"The lithium-ion conducting gel polymer electrolytes (GPE), PVAc-DMF-LiClO4 of various compositions have been prepared by solution casting technique. H-1 NMR results reveal the existence of DMF in the gel polymer electrolytes at ambient temperature. Structure and surface morphology characterization have been studied by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. Thermal and conductivity behavior of polymer- and plasticizer-salt complexes have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), TG/DTA, and impedance spectroscopy results. XRD and SEM analyses indicate the amorphous nature of the gel polymer-salt complex. DSC measurements show a decrease in T, with the increase in DMF concentrations. The thermal stability of the PVAc : DMF : LiClO4 gel polymer electrolytes has been found to be in the range of (30-60 degrees C). The dc conductivity of gel polymer electrolytes, obtained from impedance spectra, has been found to vary between 7.6 X 10(-7) and 4.1 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 303 K depending on the concentration of DMF (10-20 wt %) in the polymer electrolytes. The temperature dependence of conductivity of the polymer electrolyte complexes appears to obey the VTF behavior. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",16
"With the limited number of studies available (mostly experimental), the field of aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) batteries is in urgent need of understanding their complex electrochemical reactions. Herein, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to obtain a detailed understanding of the involved charging and discharging processes in Al–S batteries by analysis of interfacial systems S8(001)/[EMIM]AlCl4 and Al2S3(001)/[EMIM]AlCl4–electrolyte, respectively. We observe that during the discharging process, the reduction of S8 follows a layer-by-layer mechanism and involves the formation of various cationic and anionic intermediate species, which drives the formation of Al polysulfides during the course of the discharging process. The evolution of the discharge voltage profile studied over a limited timescale shows two voltage domains: the first voltage domain (1.87–2.10 V) corresponds to the interface effects of surface–electrolyte and second the voltage domain of 1.38–1.50 V starts coinciding with the experimental value of 1.30 V and involves the reduction of S8 to higher-order polysulfides. We also observe the diffusion of these higher-order Al polysulfides to the electrolyte, which is in accordance with the experimentally observed solvation of higher-order Al poylsulfides into the electrolyte. The evolution of the atomistic structure and reaction voltage during charging shows that the top atomic sublayer structural distortions are mainly limited to the layer where Al atoms are removed and not the other inner atomic layers, which could be the reason for the poor electrochemical reversibility and an increased overall charging voltage (1.75 V) in experimentally studied Al–S batteries. We believe that the new atomistic insights obtained about the formation of various intermediate species, competition of different reaction mechanisms, and importance of local Al concentration could help improve the understanding of the complex electrochemical processes observed in Al–S batteries.",7
"Despite the bright future of aluminum-sulfur (Al–S) batteries due to the ultrahigh energy-to-price ratios, the development of this new energy storage system is plagued by the shutting of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics during redox conversions. Herein, ferrocene as efficient polysulfide mediators and electrocatalysts is covalently grafted onto glass fiber (GF) membranes, which serves as separators in Al–S batteries. Attributed to the strong chemisorption and catalytic effect of metallocene toward polysulfide conversions, Al–S cells assembled with the grafted separators deliver an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1347.9 mAh g−1 (at 200 mA g−1) and desirable rate performance (328.1 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1). As validated by theoretical calculations, effective polysulfide binding is achieved through beneficial cation-π interactions between Al3+ in polysulfides and the negatively charged cyclopentadienyl ligands in ferrocene, providing novel insights into the exploration of metal-sulfur chemistries for stable energy storage.",7
"A high-voltage aluminium-sulfur (Al-S) battery is developed by employing the reversible electrochemical oxidation of S, favoring a high discharge voltage of around 1.8 V (vs Al3+/Al). The reversible multiple-electron transformation between positive- and negative-valence S compounds is further realized for activating a high-capacity Al-S battery. The formation of sulfur chlorides as charge products of S, including S2Cl2(l) as the dominant one, has been clearly identified. Benefiting from a functional polymer membrane infiltrated with AlCl3/acetamide electrolyte, which can suppress unwanted electrolyte reactions, restrict the shuttling of sulfur chlorides across the separator, and stabilize the Al anode against degradation, the Al-S battery can deliver largely enhanced performance, with a capacity of 861 mAh g−1, capacity retentions of 92.1%/79.0% within 50/200 cycles, and durability of 490 cycles. The new electrochemistry scenarios shed light on the development of S-based secondary batteries with higher energy densities for future.",7
"A new type of polymer electrolyte material for Li ion transport has been developed. This material is based on a polymerizable lyotropic (i.e., amphiphilic) liquid crystal (1) that forms a type-II bicontinuous cubic (Q(II)) phase with the common liquid electrolyte, propylene carbonate (PC), and its Li salt solutions. The resulting cross-linked, solid-liquid nanocomposite has an ordered, three-dimensional interconnected network of phase-separated liquid PC nanochannels and exhibits a room-temperature ion conductivity of 10(-4) to 10(-3) S cm(-1) when formed with 15 wt % 0.245 M LiClO4-PC solution. This value approaches that of conventional gelled poly(ethylene oxide)-based electrolytes blended with larger amounts of higher-concentration Li salt solutions. It is also similar to that of a bulk 0.245 M LiClO4-PC solution measured using the same AC impedance methods. Preliminary variable-temperature ion conductivity and NMR DOSY studies showed that liquidlike diffusion is present in the Q(II) nanochannels and that good ion conductivity (similar to 10(-4) S cm(-1)) and PC mobility are retained down to -35 degrees C (and lower). This type of stable, liquidlike ion conductivity over a broad temperature range is typically not exhibited by conventional gelled-polymer- or liquid-crystal-based electrolytes, making this new material potentially valuable for enabling Li ion batteries that can operate more efficiently over a wider temperature range.",1
"In the past 5 years, we have witnessed an increased interest in developing secondary aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) batteries. One of the main obstacles to further advance this technology is the large overpotentials observed during the recharge of the battery, which to a large extent are related to the insulating nature of the discharge product, namely Al2S3. The present work aims to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for ionic and electronic transport in Al2S3 and their eventual connection with the experimentally observed overpotentials. We use density functional theory at the hybrid functional level to determine the concentrations and mobilities of a large set of potential charge carriers in the system. We found that despite decent mobilities, all carriers exhibit negligible concentrations at equilibrium potential and thus cannot contribute to the conductivity. Nevertheless, we estimate that a 1 V overpotential (a value very close to that observed experimentally) exponentially raises the presence of negatively charged interstitial sulfur ions to the point that a practical ionic conductivity is reached. Our study points out the importance of designing strategies to increase the concentrations of charge carriers in Al2S3 to reduce the overpotentials in Al–S batteries.",7
"Rechargeable aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) batteries have been considered as a highly potential energy storage system owing to the high theoretical capacity, good safety, abundant natural reserves, and low cost of Al and S. However, the research progress of Al–S batteries is limited by the slow kinetics and shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides intermediates. Herein, an interconnected free-standing interlayer of iron single atoms supported on porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (FeSAs-NCF) on the separator is developed and used as both catalyst and chemical barrier for Al–S batteries. The atomically dispersed iron active sites (Fe–N4) are clearly identified by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure. The Al–S battery with the FeSAs-NCF shows an improved specific capacity of 780 mAh g−1 and enhanced cycle stability. As evidenced by experimental and theoretical results, the atomically dispersed iron active centers on the separator can chemically adsorb the polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics to inhibit the shuttle effect and promote the reversible conversion between aluminum polysulfides, thus improving the electrochemical performance of the Al–S battery. This work provides a new way that can not only promote the conversion of aluminum sulfides but also suppress the shuttle effect in Al–S batteries.",7
"Aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries are drawing extensive attentions for the development of economical battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g−1 and low-cost naturally abundant electrode materials, Al and S. However, Al-S batteries are beset by poor reversibility and low actual capacity, only few reversible Al-S cells have been reported until now. In this work, factors affecting Al–S batteries performance are explored and explained, such as the inactive discharge product(Al2S3), polysulfides diffusion and the self-discharge reaction on the surface of SEI-layer-free aluminum anode. And we demonstrate an improved Al–S battery by effectively adjust the voltage window and develop TiN@N-doped-graphene catalyst materials to modify the sulfur cathode. This catalyst is for the first time applied in Al–S batteries and explored its positive effects during the reversible Al-S reactions. Comprehensive electrochemical testing and ex-situ characterization certificates that, in the discharging process, the shuttle effect of polysulfides is suppressed based on the strong adsorption of catalyst; in the charging process, sulfide redox kinetics are promoted and the decomposition reaction barrier is reduced by the catalyst. The Al-S cell delivers an initial capacity of ∼993 mAh g−1 and maintains a capacity of ∼500 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles.",7
"A study of the properties of the high temperature ceramic electrolyte LixB1-x/3PO4 (lithium boron phosphate) is reported. XRD and NMR are used to investigate changes of the material as a function of heat treatment. It was found that after synthesis at 450 degreesC the material contains a phase of Li4P2O7 in addition to the BPO4 phase. This second phase is removed by heat treatment at temperatures higher than 600 degreesC. Boron vacancies are present, REDOR and CPMAS techniques are used to investigate this defect site and show that for the heat treated material Li ions are present at the vacancy site.

"Owing to their high theoretical capacity and reliable operational safety, nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) have emerged as a promising class of battery materials and been intensively studied in recent years; however, a lack of suitable, high-performing positive electrode materials, along with the need for air-sensitive and expensive ionic liquid electrolytes, has significantly hindered the practical use of RABs in large-scale applications. Therefore, we sought to carefully analyze positive electrode materials and the associated electrolytes that have been reported in these battery systems in order to stimulate the design of the next generation of high-performance and low-cost RABs. In this review, we have summarized the electrode materials that have been used in both nonaqueous and aqueous RAB systems and provided a rational classification based on the types of materials used and their respective structures. Additionally, we have reviewed electrolytes employed in RABs and have categorized them according to two main types of applications, either for fixed battery systems or for use in portable devices. A systematic account of recent developments on RABs, with a focus on electrode materials, innovative perspectives, and impending research efforts on future RABs, has been included. Finally, a proposed liquid RAB system is discussed with the aim of solving issues regarding fast-charging and long operational lifetimes, followed by insights into solid RABs for use in both portable and multistructural RAB systems.",5
"Due to an ever-increasing demand for electronic devices, rechargeable batteries are attractive for energy storage systems. A novel rechargeable aluminum-ion battery based on Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation is fabricated with Ni3S2/graphene microflakes composite as cathode material and high-purity Al foil as anode. This kind of aluminum-ion battery comprises of an electrolyte containing AlCl3 in an ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.1–2.0 V versus Al/AlCl4 −. An initial discharge specific capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 is achieved, and the discharge capacity remains over 60 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency of 99% after 100 cycles. Typically, for the current density at 200 mA g−1, the initial charge and discharge capacities are 300 and 235 mA h g−1, respectively. More importantly, it should be emphasized that the battery has a high discharge voltage plateau (≈1.0 V vs Al/AlCl4 −). These meaningful results represent a significant step forward in the development of aluminum-ion batteries.",5
"Rechargeable aluminum-ion (Al-ion) batteries have been highlighted as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage due to the abundant aluminum reserves, low cost, high intrinsic safety, and high theoretical energy density. However, the strong Coulombic interaction between the high charge density Al3+ and electrode host lattices leads to poor kinetics and insufficient cycle life in Al-ion batteries with inorganic electrodes. In contrast, organic electrode materials exhibit the advantages of designable molecular structure, flexible framework, coordinated energy storage chemistry, and resource sustainability. Nevertheless, organic materials encounter inherently high solubility, low active center utilization, and low electrical conductivity. Herein, the recent advances in developing organic positive electrode materials for Al-ion batteries is reviewed, and the charge storage mechanisms and electrochemical performances of different types of organic materials are systematically summarized. This review also discusses design strategies to improve specific capacity, operating voltage, cycle life, and rate capability of organic positive electrodes for Al-ion batteries. Finally, the challenges and research outlook toward high performance Al/organic batteries are presented.",5
"Affordable and scalable energy storage systems are necessary to mitigate the output fluctuation of an electrical power grid integrating intermittent renewable energy sources. Conventional battery technologies are unable to meet the demanding low-cost and long-life span requirements of a grid-scale application, although some of them demonstrated impressive high energy density and capacity. More recently, the prototype of an Al-ion battery has been developed using cheap electrode materials (Al and graphite) in an organic room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte. Here we implement a different Al-ion battery in an inorganic molten salt electrolyte, which contains only an extremely low-cost and nonflammable sodium chloroaluminate melt working at 120 °C. Due to the superior ionic conductivity of the melt electrolyte and the enhanced Al-ion interaction/deintercalation dynamics at an elevated temperature of 120 °C, the battery delivered a discharge capacity of 190 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and showed an excellent cyclic performance even at an extremely high current density of 4000 mA g−1: 60 mA h g−1 capacity after 5000 cycles and 43 mA h g−1 capacity after 9000 cycles, with a coulombic efficiency constantly higher than 99%. The low-cost and safe characteristics, as well as the outstanding long-term cycling capability at high current densities allow the scale-up of this brand-new battery for large-scale energy storage applications.",5
"In recent years, impressive advances in harvesting renewable energy have led to a pressing demand for the complimentary energy storage technology. Here, a high Coulombic efficiency (∼99.7%) Al battery is developed using earth-abundant aluminum as the anode, graphite as the cathode, and a cheap ionic liquid analog electrolyte made from a mixture of AlCl3 and urea in a 1.3:1 molar ratio. The battery displays discharge voltage plateaus around 1.9 and 1.5 V (average discharge = 1.73 V) and yielded a specific cathode capacity of ∼73 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 (∼1.4 C). High Coulombic efficiency over a range of charge–discharge rates and stability over ∼150–200 cycles was easily demonstrated. In situ Raman spectroscopy clearly showed chloroaluminate anion intercalation/deintercalation of graphite (positive electrode) during charge–discharge and suggested the formation of a stage 2 graphite intercalation compound when fully charged. Raman spectroscopy and NMR suggested the existence of AlCl4−, Al2Cl7− anions and [AlCl2·(urea)n]+ cations in the AlCl3/urea electrolyte when an excess of AlCl3 was present. Aluminum deposition therefore proceeded through two pathways, one involving Al2Cl7− anions and the other involving [AlCl2·(urea)n]+ cations. This battery is a promising prospect for a future high-performance, low-cost energy storage device.",5
"Advanced energy storage systems with high energy density, power density, and safety have long been the subject of concentrated studies to meet the ever-growing demand of numerous electric devices.[1–3] In this regard, rechargeable aluminumbased battery is of particular attraction since it can offer considerable advantages of high anode capacity, safety and cost-effectiveness, due to the low-cost and incombustible nature of aluminum (Al) metal anode with ultrahigh theory capacity of 2978 mAh g−1 and 8034 mAh L−1 . However, the major challenge for aluminum-ion battery (AlB) resides in cathode material, which only exhibited low discharge potential (<1.2 V), low current density (<1 A g−1) and short cycle life (<100 cycles) in previous reports.[4–8] This leads to researches in AlB over past 30 years hard to compete with those of other battery systems. Recently, Dai et al. made a breakthrough in AlB using an ionic liquid electrolyte and graphitic foam cathode, which dramatically improve the performances of cathode material with high discharge voltage (1.8 V), stable specific capacity (60 mAh g−1 ), long cycle life (7500 cycles), and high-rate performance (6 A g−1 ).[9–11] Despite these efforts, there remain two key challenges facing AlB cathode: the low capacity limits the cell energy density, and insufficient high-rate performance causes cell power density inferior to supercapacitors.",5
"Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) has been proposed as a polymeric binder for electrodes in environmentally friendly Li-ion batteries. Its physical properties and interaction with Li+ ions in water are interesting not only from the point of view of electrode preparation-processability in water is one of the main reasons for its environmental friendliness-but also for its possible application in aqueous Li-ion batteries. We combine molecular dynamics simulations and variable-time pulsed field gradient spin-echo (PFGSE) NMR spectroscopy to investigate Li+ transport in CMC-based solutions. Both the simulations and experimental results show that, at concentrations at which Li-CMC has a gel-like consistency, the Li+ diffusion coefficient is still very close to that in water. These Li+ ions interact preferentially with the carboxylate groups of CMC, giving rise to a rich variety of coordination patterns. However, the diffusion of Li+ in these systems is essentially unrestricted, with a fast, nanosecond-scale exchange of the ions between CMC and the aqueous environment.",1
"Solid polymer electrolytes based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/ammonium acetate have been prepared for different compositions by solution cast technique. The polymer electrolytes have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), DSC, conductivity studies and H-1 solid state NNM. The XRD study reveals the amorphous nature of the polymer electrolyte. The maximum protonic conductivity at room temperature has been found to be 5.62 x 10(-6) S cm(-1) for 12.5 mol% salt doped electrolyte and the electrolyte obeys Arrhenius behaviour. H-1 NMR study has been employed to develop a better understanding of the conduction mechanism. Variable temperature NMR has indicated that proton line width shows an exponential decrease with the increase of temperature. The NMR studies indicate that the NH4+ ion is responsible for the proton conduction and the anionic motion is also involved in the conduction process at higher temperature. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"Thermal runaway is a potential risk when using Li-ion batteries. A self-terminated oligomer with hyper-branched architecture (STOBA) has been demonstrated to be the most effective electrolyte safety additive for Li-ion batteries. Understanding the STOBA formation mechanism will contribute to improving such safety additives. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology enables the molecularlevel spectroscopic investigation of the STOBA synthesis reaction of N, N'-bismaleimide-4,4'-diphenylmethane (MDA-BMI) and barbituric acid (BTA) in solvent N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 90 degrees C. In this study, the STOBA synthesis reaction was studied through a series of in situ NMR experiments at different elapsed times, and the experiments were repeated at different reactant ratios to confirm the reaction mechanisms. The quantitative NMR results revealed that the Michael addition reaction between MDA-BMI and BTA is the dominant mechanism. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction between BTA molecules and the thermal radical polymerization reaction among BMI molecules are minor mechanisms, and their contributions can be ignored. The products of the STOBA synthesis reaction were found to depend on factors such as the solvent, reactant type, concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time, stir rate, and order of addition.",16
"A model for predication of the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of Li-air batteries using aqueous electrolytes is developed. The theoretical gravimetric/volumetric capacities and energy densities are calculated based on the minimum weight of the electrolyte and volume of air electrode needed for completion of the electrochemical reaction with Li metal as an anode electrode. It was determined that both theoretical gravimetric/volumetric capacities and energy densities are dependent on the porosity of the air electrode. For instance, at a porosity of 70%, the maximum theoretical cell capacities are  and  in basic electrolyte, and  and  in acidic electrolyte. The maximum theoretical cell energy densities are  and  in basic electrolyte, and  and  in acidic electrolyte. The significant deduction of cell capacity from specific capacity of Li metal is due to the bulky weight requirement from the electrolyte and air electrode materials. In contrast, the Li-air battery using a nonaqueous electrolyte does not consume electrolyte during the discharge process and has high cell energy density. For Li-air batteries using both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes, the weight increases by 8–13% and the volume decreases by 8–20% after the cell is fully discharged.",3
"Li–air batteries are potentially viable ultrahigh energy density chemical power sources, which could potentially offer specific energies up to ∼3000 Wh kg−1 being rechargeable. The modern state of art and the challenges in the field of Li–air batteries are considered. Although their implementation holds the greatest promise in a number of applications ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles, there are also impressive challenges in development of cathode materials and electrolyte systems of these batteries.",3
"Rechargeable lithium-air batteries have the potential to provide ≈3 times higher specific energy of fully packaged batteries than conventional lithium rechargeable batteries. However, very little is known about the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution in the presence of lithium ions in aprotic electrolytes, which hinders the improvement of low round-trip efficiencies of current lithium-air batteries. We report the intrinsic ORR activity on glassy carbon (GC) as well as polycrystalline Au and Pt electrodes, where Au is the most active with an activity trend of . Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were used to obtain the kinetic current of the ORR and the reaction order with respect to oxygen partial pressure in 1 M  propylene carbonate:1,2-dimethoxyethane (1:2 v/v). In addition, air electrodes with Vulcan carbon or Au or Pt nanoparticles supported on Vulcan were examined in  single cells, where the observed discharge cell voltages follow the catalytic trend established by RDE measurements. The ORR mechanism and the rate-determining steps were discussed and contrasted with the ORR activity trend in acid and alkaline solutions.",3
"In this work, Li/air batteries based on nonaqueous electrolytes were investigated in ambient conditions (with an oxygen partial pressure of 0.21 atm and relative humidity of ∼20%). A heat-sealable polymer membrane was used as both an oxygen-diffusion membrane and as a moisture barrier for Li/air batteries. The membrane also can minimize the evaporation of the electrolyte from the batteries. Li/air batteries with this membrane can operate in ambient conditions for more than one month with a specific energy of 362 Wh kg−1, based on the total weight of the battery including its packaging. Among various carbon sources used in this work, Li/air batteries using Ketjenblack (KB) carbon-based air electrodes exhibited the highest specific energy. However, KB-based air electrodes expanded significantly and absorbed much more electrolyte than electrodes made from other carbon sources. The weight distribution of a typical Li/air battery using the KB-based air electrode was dominated by the electrolyte (∼70%). Lithium metal anodes and KB-carbon account for only 5.12% and 5.78% of the battery weight, respectively. We also found that only ∼20% of the mesopore volume of the air electrode was occupied by reaction products after discharge. To further improve the specific energy of the Li/air batteries, the microstructure of the carbon electrode needs to be further improved to absorb much less electrolyte while still holding significant amounts of reaction products.",3
"Higher cationic transference number is preferred for electrolytes of lithium ion batteries, and employing macromolecular lithium salt is effective to improve the cationic transference number of the electrolytes. Therefore, a novel macromolecular lithium salt was synthesized through sulfation and neutralization of hyperbranched polyglycidol, which was obtained by cationic ring-opening polymerization. C-13-NMR analysis indicates the degree of branching of polyglycidol is about 0.5, and element analysis confirms the degree of substitution of hydroxyls can excess 0.6 after sulfation. FTIR and thermal analysis were used to characterize the hyperbranched polyglycidol and the macromolecular lithium salt derived from it. For the application of this macromolecular lithium salt in lithium ion batteries, viscosity and conductivity of its solution in the mixed solvent of EC/PC/DMF were studied. The results show that the viscosity of its dilute solution is so low that it can be compared with that of small molecular lithium salts. However, when the concentration of the solution is increased above 10% the viscosity of the solution increases quickly and reaches a very high level at the concentration of about 30% There exists a maximal conductivity of the solution while the concentration of the solution increases, and the maximum is reached at a concentration of about 10% This can be explained by the concentration and mobility of free lithium ions in the solution. Besides, the maximal conductivity of the solution is about 1.7 mS/cm at 25degreesC, which can be compared with, that of small molecular lithium salts. Considering the low viscosity and the high conductivity of its dilute solution, this macromolecular lithium salt has great potential application in inlithium ion batteries.",10
"In this work we present a new lithium salt of 4,5-dicyano-2-(trifluoromethyl) imidazopyrazine (LiTDPI) which was designed for use as an electrolyte in lithium-ion cells. It was synthesized and completely characterized by NMR techniques. The salt is thermally stable up to 350 degrees C and electrochemically stable in carbonate solvents up to +5.1 V vs. Li. Basic electrochemical characterization of this new lithium salt solution shows conductivity of over 2 mS cm(-1) at room temperature and a transference number which is higher than the commercial reference salt, LiPF6 (>0.4 in a EC:DMC 1 : 2 ratio mixture). As a proof of concept, short cycling measurements in a graphite half-cell show good capacity (352 mA h g(-1)) and capacity retention (96% after 50 cycles). The extremely good stability without compromising the performance parameters shows the next leap in progress for tailoring efficient lithium-conducting electrolytes.",0
"Practical use of lithium (Li) metal for high-energy density lithium metal batteries has been prevented by the continuous formation of Li dendrites, electrochemically isolated Li metal, and the irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Differentiating and quantifying these inactive Li species are key to understand the failure mode. Here, using operando nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy together with ex situ titration gas chromatography (TGC) and mass spectrometry titration (MST) techniques, we established a solid foundation for quantifying the evolution of dead Li metal and SEI separately. The existence of LiH is identified, which causes deviation in the quantification results of dead Li metal obtained by these three techniques. The formation of inactive Li under various operating conditions has been studied quantitatively, which revealed a general two-stage failure process for the Li metal. The combined techniques presented here establish a benchmark to unravel the complex failure mechanism of Li metal.",1
"Lithium-air (Li-air) batteries have become attractive because of their extremely high theoretical energy density. However, conventional Li-air cells operating with non-aqueous electrolytes suffer from poor cycle life and low practical energy density due to the clogging of the porous air cathode by insoluble discharge products, contamination of the organic electrolyte and lithium metal anode by moist air, and decomposition of the electrolyte during cycling. These difficulties may be overcome by adopting a cell configuration that consists of a lithium-metal anode protected from air by a Li+-ion solid electrolyte and an air electrode in an aqueous catholyte. In this type of configuration, a Li+-ion conducting “buffer” layer between the lithium-metal anode and the solid electrolyte is often necessary due to the instability of many solid electrolytes in contact with lithium metal. Based on the type of buffer layer, two different battery configurations are possible: “hybrid” Li-air batteries and “aqueous” Li-air batteries. The hybrid and aqueous Li-air batteries utilize the same battery chemistry and face similar challenges that limit the cell performance. Here, an overview of recent developments in hybrid and aqueous Li-air batteries is provided and the factors that influence their performance and impede their practical applications, followed by future directions are discussed.",3
"Nonaqueous lithium–air batteries have garnered considerable research interest over the past decade due to their extremely high theoretical energy densities and potentially low cost. Significant advances have been achieved both in the mechanistic understanding of the cell reactions and in the development of effective strategies to help realize a practical energy storage device. By drawing attention to reports published mainly within the past 8 years, this review provides an updated mechanistic picture of the lithium peroxide based cell reactions and highlights key remaining challenges, including those due to the parasitic processes occurring at the reaction product–electrolyte, product–cathode, electrolyte–cathode, and electrolyte–anode interfaces. We introduce the fundamental principles and critically evaluate the effectiveness of the different strategies that have been proposed to mitigate the various issues of this chemistry, which include the use of solid catalysts, redox mediators, solvating additives for oxygen reaction intermediates, gas separation membranes, etc. Recently established cell chemistries based on the superoxide, hydroxide, and oxide phases are also summarized and discussed.",3
"The lithium−air system captured worldwide attention in 2009 as a possible battery for electric vehicle propulsion applications. If successfully developed, this battery could provide an energy source for electric vehicles rivaling that of gasoline in terms of usable energy density. However, there are numerous scientific and technical challenges that must be overcome if this alluring promise is to turn into reality. The fundamental battery chemistry during discharge is thought to be the electrochemical oxidation of lithium metal at the anode and reduction of oxygen from air at the cathode. With aprotic electrolytes, as used in Li-ion batteries, there is some evidence that the process can be reversed by applying an external potential, i.e., that such a battery can be electrically recharged. This paper summarizes the authors’ view of the promise and challenges facing development of practical Li−air batteries and the current understanding of its chemistry. However, it must be appreciated that this perspective represents only a snapshot in a very rapidly evolving picture.",3
"Li–air batteries have received much attention in the past several years because of their large theoretical specific energy density, but the challenges with the electrolytes are the main hindrance for the development of Li–air batteries. Particularly, the electrolyte decomposition and reactivity with the discharge product Li2O2 in non-aqueous Li–air batteries (including organic solvents and ionic liquids) are severe. The solid-state electrolytes (including inorganic and polymer electrolytes), which are considered to be stable and compatible with Li2O2, will be promising alternatives to the vulnerable organic electrolytes. With the solid-state electrolytes, rechargeable solid-state Li–air batteries can be constructed and have been well studied. There is no specific review regarding the relatively new solid-state Li–air batteries. This review will include the current status, challenges, and perspectives of solid-state Li–air batteries.",3
"We report the analysis of comb-like polymers by solid-state NMR. The polymers were previously evaluated as solid-polymer-electrolytes (SPE) for lithium-polymer-metal batteries that have suitable ionic conductivity at 60 degrees C. We propose to develop a correlation between C-13 solid-state NMR measurements and phase segregation. C-13 solid-state NMR is a perfect tool for differentiating polymer phases with fast or slow motions. Li-7 was used to monitor the motion of lithium ions in the polymer, and activation energies were calculated.",16
"Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties. Owing to similar structures and properties, DESs are also called quasi-ionic liquids or ionic liquid analogous. However, for a deeper understanding and application of DESs, a comprehensive investigation on the ionicity of DESs is crucial. In this work, the effects of the structure and components of typical DESs on the ionicity were investigated. Moreover, the ionicity was discussed by using Walden plot, and the validity of applying it to DESs was verified using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR). We found that the lack of free charged species and high viscosities make it difficult to achieve optimal conductivities for DESs, and thus most of them exhibit poor ionic nature. Fortunately, with an in-depth understanding of its microstructure and physicochemical properties, the properties of DESs can be finely tailored by selecting or even designing suitable parent compounds for functional applications. In particular, the ionicity of Li-based DESs was investigated for their potential application as electrolytes in Li-ion batteries.",0
"Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membranes containing poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), PVDF/SiO2-g-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and PVDF/SiO2-g-p(methyl methacrylate-co-hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate) (PMMA-co-HEMA) organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles were prepared by phase inversion method, in which PMMA and P(MMA-co-HEMA) were successfully grafted onto the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles by the atom transfer radical polymerization method. The structure and properties of the membranes were characterized using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. In addition, the performances of pristine PVDF and PVDF nanocomposites based gel polymer electrolytes in terms of ionic conductivity, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), C-rate and cycling performance were investigated. The performance of the prepared membranes combined with 1 M LiClO4 in propylene carbonate improved by introducing HEMA groups (GPE3). The ionic conductivity of GPE3 was 2.63 mS cm(-1) at 298 K. The electrochemical stability window of SiO2-g-P(MMA-co-HEMA) containing GPE was established to be as high as 4.8 V (vs. Li/Li+). Besides, the Li/LiMn2O4 cell with the GPE3 showed excellent cyclic stability and rate performance. The results suggest the GPE3 is promising to be applied for rechargeable Li batteries with high safety and long cycle life.",0
"Despite growing interest in calcium (Ca)-based batteries for sustainable energy storage, there are a limited number of electrolytes that enable the reversible plating/stripping of Ca metal. Consequently, an understanding of the interplay between electrolyte formulation, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, and electrochemical performance lags behind that of other alkali and alkaline-earth batteries. In this context, this study examines how plating/stripping behavior and SEI formation are modulated by differential changes in solvent composition and the resulting Ca2+-anion speciation in borohydride electrolytes comprising ether solvent blends. Starting with the baseline electrolyte 1 M Ca(BH4)(2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), THF was systematically replaced by 1,2-dimethoxyethane (G1) or bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (G2) over a range of Gx:Ca2+ molar ratios (0-4:1 G1:Ca2+ or 0-3:1 G2:Ca2+). Replacement of THF by glymes increased the plating overpotential and decreased the Coulombic efficiency of Ca plating/stripping, and a marked decrease in electrochemical activity occurred at a composition threshold for each glyme. Comparison between the X-ray photoelectron spectra of electrolyte-soaked Ca and electrodeposited Ca revealed a relative increase in organic C-O species and a decrease in borate species in the electrochemically-formed SEI with increased glyme proportion in the electrolyte. NMR and Raman spectroscopy connected SEI composition to differential Ca2+ coordination, as glymes displace THF from the Ca2+ coordination environment, weaken Ca2+-BH4- interactions, and prompt BH4- reorganization. Overall, BH(4)(-)facilitated solvent decomposition governs Ca electrochemistry in these systems, as coordinated THF promotes beneficial borate formation but coordinated glymes limit such phases, leading to Ca2+-blocking phases in the SEI. These findings delineate future directions to modulate Ca(BH4)(2) coordination toward improving electrolyte reversibility by considering the O-donating ability of the coordinating solvent.",16
"Synthesis of phosphorus containing polyethers and their lithium-ion conductivities for the potential use as solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) in high-energy density lithium-ion batteries have been described. Co-polymerization of butyl bis(hydroxymethyl)phosphine oxide with three different dibromo monomers were carried out to produce three novel phosphorous containing polyethers (P1-P3). These polymers were obtained via nucleophilic substitution reactions and were characterized by H-1, P-31 NMR spectral data and gel permeation chromatography. SPEs were prepared using polyethers (P1 and P2) with various amounts of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The lithium-ion conductivity of SPE2 containing 40 wt% of LiTFSI was 2.1 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at room temperature and 3.7 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 80A degrees C.",0
"The surface reactions of electrolytes with a silicon anode in lithium ion cells have been investigated The investigation utilizes two novel techniques that are enabled by the use of binder-free silicon (BF-Si) nanoparticle anodes. The first method, transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, allows straightforward analysis of the BF-Si solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The second method utilizes multi-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of D2O extracts from the cycled anodes. The TEM and NMR data are complemented by XPS and FTIR data, which are routinely, used for SEI studies. Coin cells (BF-Si/Li) were cycled in electrolytes containing LiPF6 salt and ethylene carbonate or fluoroethylene carbonate solvent Capacity retention was significantly better for cells cycled with LiPF6/FEC electrolyte than for cells cycled with LiPF6/EC electrolyte. Our unique combination of techniques establishes that for LiPF6/EC electrolyte the BF-Si SEI continuously grows during the first 20 cycles and the SEI becomes integrated with the BF-Si nanoparticles. The SEI predominantly contains lithium ethylene dicarbonate, LiF, and LixSiOy. BF-Si electrodes cycled with LiPF6/FEC electrolyte have a different behavior; the BF-Si nanoparticles remain relatively distinct from the SEI. The SEI predominantly contains LiF, LixSiOy, and an insoluble polymeric species.",0
"Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) find widespread applications as an electrolyte and/or electrode binder in fuel cells, electrodialysis stacks, flow and metal-air batteries, and electrolyzers. AEMs exhibit poor stability in alkaline media; their degradation is induced by the hydroxide ion, a potent nucleophile. We have used 2D NMR techniques to investigate polymer backbone stability (as opposed to cation stability) of the AEM in alkaline media. We report the mechanism behind a peculiar, often-observed phenomenon, wherein a demonstrably stable polysulfone backbone degrades rapidly in alkaline solutions upon derivatization with alkaline stable fixed cation groups. Using COSY and heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy (2D NMR), we unequivocally demonstrate that the added cation group triggers degradation of the polymer backbone in alkaline via quaternary carbon hydrolysis and ether hydrolysis, leading to rapid failure. This finding challenges the existing perception that having a stable cation moiety is sufficient to yield a stable AEM and emphasizes the importance of the often ignored issue of backbone stability.",15
"In this study, we experimentally measure the viscosity, eta, and ionic conductivity, sigma, of 1 mol kg(-1) LiPF6 dissolved in a binary solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) by varying the EC content from 0 to 60vol%. Replacing EC with PC does not significantly influence on the mechanism of flow and ionic conduction. The state of solvent solvating to Li+ is analyzed using Raman spectra and C-13-NMR; the quantitative analysis suggests that the preference of EC in the Li+ solvation shell is almost similar to that of PC. The diffusion coefficient, D, of each species, Li+, PF6-, EC, and PC, is determined by pulse-gradient spin-echo NMR. In the electrolyte system dealt in this study, the molar conductivity is dominated by only the D of the charge carriers. The hydrodynamic Stokes radius of all constituent species is expressed in terms of D and eta using the Stokes-Einstein relation. As for coordinated-Li+, a comparison between the Stokes radius and the van der Waals radius or the radius considering the free volume suggests that Li+ diffuses while dragging not only a coordination shell that can be spectroscopically detected but also an outer shell that binds loosely to Li+.

"In this study, the microstructure of mangrove-charcoal-derived carbon (MC) was studied using XRD, STM and TEM. MC was found to consist of aligned quasi-spherical structural units with diameters of around 5-20 nm. It shows typical hard carbon characteristics, including a strongly disoriented single graphene layer and BSU, formed by two or three graphene layers stacked nearly parallel. Some curved and faceted graphene layers, especially closed carbon nanoparticles with fullerene-like, were observed in the as-prepared samples. MC was also evaluated as an anodic material for Li-ion batteries. MC carbonized at 1000 degrees C possessed the highest available discharge capacity (below 0.5V) of 335 mAh g(-1), the high first-cycle coulombic efficiency of 73.7%, good rate and cyclic capability and PC-based electrolyte compatibility. Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of fully lithiated mangrove charcoal-derived carbons indicated the co-existence of three Li species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries offer considerably higher gravimetric energy density than commercial Li-ion batteries (up to three times) but suffer from poor power, cycle life, and round-trip efficiency. Tuning the thermodynamics and pathway of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aprotic electrolytes can be used to enhance the Li-O-2 battery rate and discharge capacity. In this work, we present a systematic study on the role of the solvent and anion on the thermodynamics and kinetics of Li+ORR, from which we propose a unified descriptor for its pathway and kinetics. First, by thoroughly characterizing the solvation environment of Li+ ions using Raman spectroscopy, Li-7 NMR, ionic conductivity, and viscosity measurements, we observe increasing Li+-anion interactions with increasing anion DN in low DN solvents such as 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane and acetonitrile but minimal Lr-anion interactions in the higher DN dimethyl sulfoxide. Next, by determining the electrolyte-dependent Li+/Li, TBA(+),O-2/TBA(+)-O-2, and Li+,O-2 /Li+-O-2-redox potentials versus the solvent-invariant Me(10)Fc reference potential, we show that stronger combined solvation of Li+ and O-2- ions leads to weaker Li+-O-2 coupling. Finally, using rotating ring disk electrode measurements, we show that weaker is Li+-O-2 coupling in electrolytes with strong combined solvation leads to an increased generation of soluble Li+-O-2-type species and faster overall kinetics during Li+ORR.",3
"Degradation of the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 upon air exposure, assigned to a corrosion-type aging mechanism, implies the incorporation of hydroxyl groups and the formation of an amorphous tavorite-like phase at the surface. Using a carbon coating provides an efficient protection from this detrimental process but also modifies the surface in contact with the electrolyte. The formation and evolution of electrode/electrolyte interphases forming on both air-aged and carbon coated LiFePO4 are discussed based on combined quantitative Li-7, F-19 MAS NMR, EIS and EELS measurements. Concerning the air-aged LiFePO4, the electrode/electrolyte interactions are dominated by the dissolution of the active material and an exacerbated reaction of incorporated hydroxyl groups with the electrolyte salt, resulting in a LiF rich interphase. This dissolution of the outer part of active material particles is accompanied by the departure of the previously formed interphase and a new interphase is then formed on a newly exposed surface. The resistive LiF rich interphase passivates the active material particles during cycling, forming a resistive film, hindering both Li ion transfer and material corrosion. Cellulose acetate based carbon coating prevents air-aging but yields to an accumulation of organic lithiated species, allowing Li transfer and maintaining good electrochemical performance.

"We study the aqueous solvation dynamics of lithium ions using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and viscosity measurements. Several relaxation mechanisms are examined to explain the strong increases of spin-lattice relaxation toward high concentrations. The use of both Li-6 and Li-7 isotopes is helpful to identify the quadrupolar contribution to the relaxation rate. In particular, it is found that the quadrupolar interaction constitutes the strongest contribution above a concentration of similar to 10 molal. The next-strongest contribution arises from interactions that scale with the square of the gyromagnetic ratio (mostly the dipolar interaction), and the experimental relaxation rates appear to be fully accounted for when these mechanisms are combined over the concentration range up to the saturation concentration. The study of solvation dynamics, particularly at high concentrations, could be of relevance for electrolyte dynamics in aqueous Li-ion rechargeable batteries.",0
"The future of lithium metal batteries as a widespread, safe and reliable form of high-energy-density rechargeable battery depends on a significant advancement in the electrolyte material used in these devices. Molecular solvent-based electrolytes have been superceded by polymer electrolytes in some prototype devices(1), primarily in a drive to overcome leakage and flammability problems, but these often exhibit low ionic conductivity and prohibitively poor lithium-ion transport(2-4). To overcome this, it is necessary to encourage dissociation of the lithium ion from the anionic polymer backbone, ideally without the introduction of competing, mobile ionic species. Here we demonstrate the effect of zwitterionic compounds, where the cationic and anionic charges are immobilized on the same molecule, as extremely effective lithium ion 'dissociation enhancers'. The zwitterion produces electrolyte materials with conductivities up to seven times larger than the pure polyelectrolyte gels, a phenomenon that appears to be common to a number of different copolymer and solvent systems.",1
"Motivated by its high surface area and electrical conductivity, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) flakes have been intensively studied as potential anode materials for lithium ion battery (LIB). The high capacity in rGO (600-1000 mA h g(-1)) compared to graphite (372 mA h g(-1)) suggest that a different lithiation mechanism may be operational in the former. The high capacity of rGO should be attributed to its high surface area and associated defective sites, however, these may act as trapping sites and undergo side reactions with the solvent and lithium ions to form the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) upon lithiation, resulting in irreversible capacity loss (ICL) during the initial cycles. Elucidating the temporal evolution of SEI layer on rGO and quantifying the amount of trapped lithium will be useful in developing strategies to mitigate the ICL process. Herein, the Li intercalation mechanism in rGO and graphite was investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy and in situ time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide insights into the origins of the high capacity and ICL loss in rGO. Finally, the dynamic and static SEI passive layer formed on rGO flakes was monitored, and a method was developed to quantify the amount of Li+ trapped in the SEI layer.",0
"Ionic liquids (IL) composed of a quaternary ammonium cation having an ether chain, N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium (DEME) are electrochemically stable and used in electric double layer capacitors and also one of important candidates to use lithium secondary batteries. In this study, three DEME-based ILs with anions BF4, CF3BF3, and N(SO2CF3)(2) were studied by measuring temperature dependences of ionic conductivity sigma, viscosity eta and density rho. Also ion diffusion coefficients D-anion and D-cation were obtained by NMR spectroscopy in the wide temperature range. Using the classical Stokes-Einstein (SE) and Nernst-Einstein (NE) equations, the relationships between eta and D, and sigma and D were evaluated. The lithium salt doping effects were studied by Li-7 NMR spectroscopy. The lithium ion diffusion was slower than other ion diffusion at every temperature. Arrhenius-type plots of Li-7 T-1 showed minima in the three doped samples. Then one-jump distance of lithium ion was estimated in the temperature range between 273 and 373 K.",0
"For the development of advanced batteries, it is essential to correlate information obtained from the characterization of materials to properties critical to the battery's performance. In situ/operando characterization and cells specifically designed to conduct such analyses have proven to be the best means of accomplishing that objective. However, complimentary analytical techniques are required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of those changes, pointing to a need for devices that allow for multimodal, in situ/operando characterization of materials and interfaces. This perspective briefly examines the evolution of in situ and operando devices and highlights important considerations in designing such devices. From that discussion arises a clear opportunity regarding the evolution of these devices: magnify their usefulness through incorporating near-simultaneous, multimodal capabilities to advance the development of electrochemical energy storage materials.",15
"In the past decade, there have been exciting developments in the field of lithium ion batteries as energy storage devices, resulting in the application of lithium ion batteries in areas ranging from small portable electric devices to large power systems such as hybrid electric vehicles. However, the maximum energy density of current lithium ion batteries having topatactic chemistry is not sufficient to meet the demands of new markets in such areas as electric vehicles. Therefore, new electrochemical systems with higher energy densities are being sought, and metal-air batteries with conversion chemistry are considered a promising candidate. More recently, promising electrochemical performance has driven much research interest in Li-air and Zn-air batteries.

"As an emerging battery technology, metal–air flow batteries inherit the advantageous features of the unique structural design of conventional redox flow batteries and the high energy density of metal–air batteries, thus showing great potential as efficient electrochemical systems for large-scale electrical energy storage. This review summarizes the operating principles and recent progress of metal–air flow batteries from a materials and chemistry perspective, with particular emphasis on the latest advanced materials design and cell configuration engineering, which the authors divide into three categories based on the anode species: vanadium–air, zinc–air, and lithium–air flow batteries. Since some of the capabilities developed for metal–air static batteries can be leveraged for next-generation flow systems, classical works on conventional metal–air batteries are selected and compared with the metal–air flow systems, highlighting the prominent advantages of the latter in achieving high energy capacity and long cycle performance. At the end, a general perspective on current challenges/opportunities and future research directions to promote the commercial application of the metal–air flow battery technology is provided.

"Because of the remarkably high theoretical energy output, metal–air batteries represent one class of promising power sources for applications in next-generation electronics, electrified transportation and energy storage of smart grids. The most prominent feature of a metal–air battery is the combination of a metal anode with high energy density and an air electrode with open structure to draw cathode active materials (i.e., oxygen) from air. In this critical review, we present the fundamentals and recent advances related to the fields of metal–air batteries, with a focus on the electrochemistry and materials chemistry of air electrodes. The battery electrochemistry and catalytic mechanism of oxygen reduction reactions are discussed on the basis of aqueous and organic electrolytes. Four groups of extensively studied catalysts for the cathode oxygen reduction/evolution are selectively surveyed from materials chemistry to electrode properties and battery application: Pt and Pt-based alloys (e.g., PtAu nanoparticles), carbonaceous materials (e.g., graphene nanosheets), transition-metal oxides (e.g., Mn-based spinels and perovskites), and inorganic–organic composites (e.g., metal macrocycle derivatives). The design and optimization of air-electrode structure are also outlined.

The [PPN](4)[1]center dot 2MeCN salt was also structurally characterized, crystallizing in the monoclinic P2(1)/c space group. Treatment of 1 with [(p-BrC6H4)(3)N](+) allowed for isolation of the one-electron-oxidized spincrossover (SCO) complex, [Co(P3O9)(2)](3-) (3), which is the active catholyte species generated during cell charging. The success of the 1-2 cell provides a promising entry point to a potential future class of transition-metal metaphosphate-based all-inorganic non-aqueous redoxflow battery electrolytes.",16
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques have been used to determine dominant failure modes of LiMn2O4-based positive electrode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries, and to elucidate the role of metal-formanganese substitution in the stabilization of the material toward electrochemical cycling on the 4 V plateau. Various compositions were cycled galvanostatically (C/15 rate) from 3.3 to 4.4 V vs. Li metal at room temperature using a 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:2) electrolyte. A rapid capacity fade was observed for LiMn2O4, which was mitigated to varying extents by substitution of some of the Mn by other metals. After cycling, the Li-7 magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR peaks broadened, and the peaks assigned to lithium near defects increased in relative intensity. These changes were most pronounced for the poor-performing LiMn2O4, and were almost undetectable in the most robust compositions. The results for the cycled electrodes were compared to results for electrodes which had been exposed to model degradation processes chosen so as to mimic failure by one of the possible mechanisms proposed in the literature. This comparison provided substantial evidence that manganese dissolution and concomitant Li-for-Mn ion exchange at the end-of-discharge is the dominant mode of failure on the 4 V plateau. Cr substitution effectively mitigated this failure mode. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.",0
"Out of the many challenges in the realization of lithium-O-2 batteries (LOB), the major is to deal with the instability of the electrolyte and the cathode interface under the stringent environment of both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Lithium nitrate was recently proposed as a promising salt for LOB because of its capability to stabilize the lithium anode by the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase, its low level of dissociation in aprotic solvents, and its catalytic effect toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable LOB. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the influence of nitrate on the stability and electrochemical response of the cathode in LOB is yet to be realized. Additionally, it is well accepted that carbon instability toward oxidation therefore, it is essential to investigate the effect of electrolyte components on this side of the battery. In the present work, we show that nitrate leads to interfacial changes, which result in the formation of a surface protection domain on the carbon scaffold of LOB cathode, which helps in suppressing the oxidative damage of the carbon. This effect is conjugated with an additional electrocatalytic effect of the nitrate ion on the OER Using in operando online electrochemical mass spectroscopy, we herein deconvolute these two positive effects and show how they are dependent on nitrate concentration and the potential of cell operation. We show that a low amount of nitrate can exhibit the catalytic behavior; however, in order to harness its ability to suppress the oxidative damage and passivate the carbon surface, an excess of LiNO3 is required.",3
"Among post Li-ion battery technologies, Al-ion batteries are receiving growing attention due to the high abundance of Al, low cost, ease of handling in an ambient environment, and high theoretical capacities obtained from three-electron redox process. Here, the physicochemical properties of AlCl3 and urea mixtures known as deep eutectic solvents or ionic liquid analogs (ILAs) are investigated by changing the molar ratio of AlCl3/urea in the range of 1.0-1.6. Multinuclear (Al-27, C-13, H-1) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) are used to determine the speciation of ionic moieties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of this complex system. On the basis of the composition-property results, 1.4 molar ratio of AlCl3/urea was selected as the best composition and was used as the electrolyte in an Al-cell made of Al anode and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) cathode. The battery delivered a specific capacity of 74 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and it retained a specific capacity of similar to 40 mAh g(-1) at a very high current of 1000 mA g(-1).

"The metal-air batteries with the largest theoretical energy densities have been paid much more attention. However, metal-air batteries including Li-air/O2, Li-CO2, Na-air/O2, and Zn-air/O2 batteries, are complex systems that have their respective scientific problems, such as metal dendrite forming/deforming, the kinetics of redox mediators for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, high overpotentials, desolution of CO2, H2O, etc. from the air and related side reactions on both anode and cathode. It should be the main direction to address these shortages to improve performance. Here, we summarized recently research progress in these metal-air/O2 batteries. Some perspectives are also provided for these research fields.",16
"Metal–air batteries have a theoretical energy density that is much higher than that of lithium-ion batteries and are frequently advocated as a solution toward next-generation electrochemical energy storage for applications including electric vehicles or grid energy storage. However, they have not fulfilled their full potential because of challenges associated with the metal anode, air cathode, and electrolyte. These challenges will have to be properly resolved before metal–air batteries can become a practical reality and be deployed on a large scale. Here we survey the current status and latest advances in metal–air battery research for both aqueous (e.g., Zn–air) and nonaqueous (e.g., Li–air) systems. An overview of the general technical issues confronting their development is presented, and our perspective on possible solutions is offered.",16
"With the ever-increasing demand for power sources of high energy density and stability for emergent electrical vehicles and portable electronic devices, rechargeable batteries (such as lithium-ion batteries, fuel batteries, and metal–air batteries) have attracted extensive interests. Among the emerging battery technologies, metal–air batteries (MABs) are under intense research and development focus due to their high theoretical energy density and high level of safety. Although significant progress has been achieved in improving battery performance in the past decade, there are still numerous technical challenges to overcome for commercialization. Herein, this mini-review summarizes major issues vital to MABs, including progress on packaging and crucial manufacturing technologies for cathode, anode, and electrolyte. Future trends and prospects of advanced MABs by additive manufacturing and nanoengineering are also discussed.",16
"With the development of renewable energy and electrified transportation, electrochemical energy storage will be more important in the future than it has ever been in the past. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are traditionally considered to be the most likeliest candidate thanks to their relatively long cycle life and high energy efficiency, their limited energy density as well as cost are still causing a bottleneck for their long-term application. Alternatively, metal–air batteries have been proposed as a very promising large-scale electricity storage technology with the replacement of the intercalation reaction mechanism by the catalytic redox reaction of a light weight metal–oxygen couple. Generally, based on the electrolyte, these metal–air batteries can be divided into aqueous and nonaqueous systems, corresponding to two typical batteries of Zn–air and Li–air, respectively. The prominent feature of both batteries are their extremely high theoretical energy density, especially for nonaqueous Li–air batteries, which far exceeds the best that can be achieved with LIBs. In this review, we focus on the major obstacle of sluggish kinetics of the cathode in both batteries, and summarize the fundamentals and recent advances related to the oxygen catalyst materials. According to the electrolyte, the aqueous and nonaqueous electrocatalytic mechanisms of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are discussed. Subsequently, seven groups of oxygen catalysts, which have played catalytic roles in both systems, are selectively reviewed, including transition metal oxides (single-metal oxides and mixed-metal oxides), functional carbon materials (nanostructured carbons and doped carbons), metal oxide–nanocarbon hybrid materials, metal–nitrogen complexes (non-pyrolyzed and pyrolyzed), transition metal nitrides, conductive polymers, and precious metals (alloys). Nonaqueous systems have the advantages of energy density and rechargeability over aqueous systems and have gradually become the research focus of metal–air batteries. However, there are considerable challenges beyond catalysts from aqueous to nonaqueous electrolytes, which are also discussed in this review. Finally, several future research directions are proposed based on the results achieved in this field, with emphasis on nonaqueous Li–air batteries.",16
"Several new sulfonium ionic liquids (ILs) with dicyanamide ([DCA](-)) and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([TFSI](-)) counter anions have been synthesized. Their viscosity and ionic conductivity values were determined. The ILs with [DCA](-) were previously prepared by the metathesis reaction involving silver dicyanamide (AgDCA). We report here a very convenient and much less expensive method using an ion-exchange resin. The structures of these ILs have been confirmed by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, and elemental analysis. Some of these sulfonium ILs displayed low viscosity (< 30 cP) and high ionic conductivity (> 10 mS cm(-1)). A concluding remark on structure-property relationship has also been drawn involving alicyclic and cyclic sulfonium cations vs. [DCA](-) and [TFSI](-) anions.",16
"Liquid structures, transport properties, and electrochemical properties of binary mixtures of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA) and dinitrile solvents [succinonitrile (SN), glutaronitrile (GN), and adiponitrile (ADN)] were investigated. In the LiTFSA/SN and LiTFSA/ADN systems, the stable crystalline solvates of LiTFSA-(SN)(1.5) [melting point (T-m): 59 degrees C] and LiTFSA-(ADN)(1.5) (T-m: 50 degrees C) were formed, respectively. In contrast, the LiTFSA/GN mixtures of a wide range of compositions were found to be glass-forming liquids at room temperature. Raman spectroscopy of LiTFSA/GN liquid mixtures revealed that increasing the LiTFSA concentration results in the formation of the solvent-bridged network structure Li+-GN-Li+. In addition, the considerable formation of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates was observed in highly concentrated electrolytes. In the liquids, the Li+ ion dynamically exchanged ligands (GN and TFSA) and higher LiTFSA concentrations led to an increase in the ratio of the self-diffusion coefficients of Li+ and TFSA(-), D-Li/D-TFSA, as determined by pulsed field gradient NMR spectroscopy. The Li+ transference number (t(Li+)) of the [LiTFSA]/[GN] = 1/1.5 electrolyte in an electrochemical cell under anion-blocking conditions was estimated to be as high as 0.74. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements revealed that the reductive stability of the LiTFSA/GN electrolyte increases with increasing LiTFSA concentration. A [LiTFSA]/[GN] = 1/1.5 electrolyte is stable against the Li metal electrode, provided that the polarization is relatively small. Owing to high t(Li+), a Li-S battery with the [LiTFSA]/[GN] = 1/1.5 electrolyte showed a high rate discharge capability despite its low ionic conductivity (0.21 mS cm(-1)) at room temperature.

"The water-in-salt concept has significantly improved the electrochemical stability of aqueous electrolytes, and the hybridization with organic solvents or ionic liquids has further enhanced their reductive stability, enabling cell chemistries with up to 150 Wh kg(-1) of active material. Here, a large design space is opened by introducing succinonitrile as a cosolvent in water/ionic liquid/succinonitrile hybrid electrolytes (WISHEs). By means of succinonitrile addition, the solubility limits can be fully circumvented, and the properties of the electrolytes can be optimized for various metrics such as highest electrochemical stability, maximum conductivity, or lowest cost. While excessive nitrile fractions render the mixtures flammable, careful selection of component ratios yields highly performant, nonflammable electrolytes that enable stable cycling of Li4Ti5O12-LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cells over a wide temperature range with strong rate performance, facilitated by the fast conformational dynamics of succinonitrile. The WISHEs allow stable cycling with a maximum energy density of approximate to 140 Wh kg(-1) of active material, Coulombic efficiencies of close to 99.5% at 1C, and a capacity retention of 53% at 10C relative to 1C.",9
"In order to develop new electrode and electrolyte materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), it is crucial to understand a number of fundamental issues. These include the compositions of the bulk and interface, the structures of the materials used, and the electrochemical reactions in the batteries. Solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) has unique advantages in characterizing the local or microstructure of solid electrode/electrolyte materials and their interfaces-one such advantage is that these are determined in a noninvasive and nondestructive manner at the atomic level. In this review, we provide a survey of the recent advances in the understanding of the fundamental issues of SIBs using advanced NMR techniques. First, we summarize the applications of SS-NMR in characterizing electrode material structures and solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI). In particular, we elucidate the key role of in-situ NMR/MRI in revealing the complex reactions and degradation mechanisms of SIBs. Next, the characteristics and shortcomings of SS-NMR and MRI techniques in SIBs are also discussed in comparison to similar Li-ion batteries. Finally, an overview of SS-NMR and MRI techniques for sodium batteries are briefly discussed and presented.",8
"Advanced rechargeable batteries with long cycle life, high safety and low cost through multiple electrochemically reversible reactions are practically attractive. Recently, aluminum-ion batteries have attracted extraordinary attention owing to their unique advantages, such as low cost, low flammability and high stability. Herein, we firstly introduce a reversible dual-graphite intercalation chemistry with simultaneous deposition of Al3+ and intercalation of AlCl4- in graphitic materials for a new aluminum-ion battery based on an ionic liquid electrolyte. This novel dual-graphite aluminum-ion battery (DGAB) shows excellent cycling life with a stable discharge capacity of ~70 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, a superior cycling coulombic efficiency (98.5%) and great rate capability, retaining ~70 mA h g−1 over 600 continuous cycles. In addition, the battery offers a high discharge voltage approaching 2.1 V (vs. Al3+/Al). This work paves ways for further developing aluminum-ion batteries for the wide range of energy storage applications.",5
"To develop high-power and high-energy batteries with a long life remains a great challenge, even combining the benefits of metal (fast kinetics and high capacity) and carbon materials (robust structure). Among them, Al-ion batteries based on aluminum anode and graphite carbon cathode have gained lots of interests as one of the most promising technologies. Here, it is demonstrated that the size of graphitic material in ab plane and c direction plays an important role in anion intercalation chemistry. Sharply decreasing the size of vertical dimension (c direction) strongly facilitates the kinetics and charge transfer of anions (de)intercalation. On the other hand, increasing the size of horizontal dimension (ab plane) contributes to improving the flexibility of graphitic materials, which results in raising the cycling stability. Meanwhile, chloroaluminate anions are reversibly intercalated into the interlayer of graphite materials, leading to the staging behaviors. In the end, an ultrafast Al-ion battery with exceptional long life is achieved based on large-sized few-layer graphene as a cathode and aluminum metal as an anode.",5
"Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) have been regarded as a promising candidate for large-scale stationary energy storage applications based on their low cost, good safety and high volumetric capacity. However, the lack of suitable cathode materials with highly reversible aluminum storage has hindered their practical use. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible AIB using porous Co3S4 microspheres as the cathode material. The microstructure gives Co3S4 a superior electrochemical performance to most other cathode materials for AIBs reported so far. It is further shown that the cell undergoes Al3+ intercalation/deintercalation with Co3+/Co2+ as a redox couple in the cathode, and electrochemical stripping/plating of metallic aluminum in the anode. We also found that the diffusion of Al3+ in the host Co3S4 is the key kinetic step that limits the discharge/charge current density. This work is a step forward in the development of a low-cost cathode material for high-performance AIBs and contributes to a better understanding of AIB chemistry.",5
"A polymer gel electrolyte using AlCl3 complexed acrylamide as a functional monomer and acidic ionic liquid based on a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMImCl) and AlCl3 (EMImCl–AlCl3, 1–1.5, in molar ratio) as a plasticizer has been successfully prepared for the first time via free radical polymerization. Aluminum deposition is successfully achieved using a polymer gel electrolyte containing 80 wt% ionic liquid. The polymer gel electrolytes are also good candidates for rechargeable aluminum ion batteries.",5
"Al-ion batteries (AIBs) have been identified as one of the most hopeful energy storage systems after Li-ion batteries on account for the ultrahigh volumetric capacity, high safety and low cost from the rich abundance of Al. Nonetheless, some inevitable shortcomings, such as the formation of passive oxide film, hydrogen side reactions and anode corrosion, finally limit the large-scale application of aqueous AIBs. The nonaqueous AIBs have been considered as one of most hopeful alternatives for high-powered electrochemical energy storage devices. Nonetheless, various technical and scientific obstacles should be resolved because nonaqueous AIBs are still nascent. Some significant efforts have aimed to resolve these issues towards large-scale applications, and some important advancement has been made. In the present review, we mainly intended to offer an overview of non-aqueous AIBs systems, and we comprehensively reviewed the recent research advancement of the cathode materials, anode materials electrolyte and collectors as well as the fundamental understanding of the functional mechanisms. In addition, we have also analyzed several technical challenges and summarized the strategies used for overcoming the challenges in improving the electrochemical properties, including morphology control, surface engineering, doping and construction of composite electrodes as well as the charge storage mechanisms of the materials with different crystal structures. At last, future research orientation and development prospect of the AIBs are proposed.",5
"On the basis of low-cost, rich resources, and safety performance, aluminum-ion batteries have been regarded as a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage batteries in large-scale energy applications. A rechargeable aluminum-ion battery has been fabricated based on a 3D hierarchical copper sulfide (CuS) microsphere composed of nanoflakes as cathode material and room-temperature ionic liquid containing AlCl3 and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl) as electrolyte. The aluminum-ion battery with a microsphere electrode exhibits a high average discharge voltage of ∼1.0 V vs Al/AlCl4–, reversible specific capacity of about 90 mA h g–1 at 20 mA g–1, and good cyclability of nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles. Such remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the well-defined nanostructure of the cathode material facilitating the electron and ion transfer, especially for chloroaluminate ions with large size, which is desirable for aluminum-ion battery applications.",5
"Few layer graphene is a promising cathode material for aluminum-ion batteries that use chloroaluminate (AlCl4-) ionic liquids as the electrolyte. A fundamental understanding of interactions between the few layer graphene cathode and the ionic liquid electrolyte is key for realizing the full potential of these systems. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that the cathode is capable of achieving stage-one intercalation within the operating voltage window, leading to improved cell performance. We also show that the presence of structural defects in few layer graphene such as pores induced via plasma exposure or nitrogen dopants can deteriorate the cell performance by either decreasing the electrical connectivity or precluding stage-one intercalation respectively. The cathodes made with highly crystalline few layer graphene display high power and energy densities (~ 200 W h kg−1 at 200 W kg−1 and ~ 160 W h kg−1 at 5000 W kg−1), and are stable with no loss in performance up to 1000 cycles while fully charging to 2.4 V.",5
"The electrolyte system of rechargeable aluminium-ion batteries (AIBs) is an urgent topic on account of the development in large-scale applications. In addition to the energy storage capabilities, enlargement of the electrolyte potential window is also a significant strategy for substantially boosting the energy density of the AIBs. To achieve these goals, here we demonstrate an Et3NHCl-based gel-polymer electrolyte with a wide electrochemical potential window for high-rate quasi-solid-state AIBs. Particularly, such a quasi-solid-state AIB presents stable specific capacities, maintaining around 90 mA h g−1 with long-term cycling under a high current density. More importantly, the Et3NHCl-based gel-polymer electrolyte here is not only favorable for increasing the cut-off charging potential, but also has various advantages, including a robust electrode–electrolyte interface, wide-temperature operating abilities and stability in a moist environment. Thus, the results may open a new avenue for low-cost and safe energy storage systems based on electrochemical technologies and applications.",5
"The reversible capacity of AlCl4− intercalation/de-intercalation in conventional cathodes of aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) is difficult to improve due to the large size of AlCl4− anions. Therefore, it is highly desirable to realize the intercalation/de-intercalation of smaller Al-based ions. Here, we fabricated polyaniline/single-walled carbon nanotubes (PANI/SWCNTs) composite films and protonated the PANI nanorods. The protonation endows PANI with more active sites and enhanced conductivity. Hyper self-protonated PANI (PANI(H+)) exhibits reversible AlCl2+ intercalation/de-intercalation during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the discharge capacity of the Al/PANI(H+) battery is twice as high as that of the initial composite films. PANI(H+)@SWCNT electrodes also have a stable cycling life with only 0.003 % capacity decay per cycle over 8000 cycles. Owing to the excellent mechanical properties, PANI(H+)@SWCNT composite films can act as the electrodes of flexible AIBs.",5
"The strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and close-packed crystalline structures, and the single-electron transfer ability of traditional cationic redox cathodes, pose challenged for the development of high-performance rechargeable aluminum batteries. Here, to break the confinement of fixed lattice spacing on the diffusion and storage of Al-ion, we developed a previously unexplored family of amorphous anion-rich titanium polysulfides (a-TiSx, x = 2, 3, and 4) (AATPs) with a high concentration of defects and a large number of anionic redox centers. The AATP cathodes, especially a-TiS4, achieved a high reversible capacity of 206 mAh/g with a long duration of 1000 cycles. Further, the spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that sulfur anions in the AATP cathodes act as the main redox centers to reach local electroneutrality. Simultaneously, titanium cations serve as the supporting frameworks, undergoing the evolution of coordination numbers in the local structure.",5
"The ion dynamics in a novel sodium-containing room-temperature ionic liquid (IL) consisting of an ether-functionalised quaternary ammonium cation and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide [NTf2] anion with various concentrations of Na[NTf2] have been characterised using differential scanning calorimetry, impedance spectroscopy, diffusometry and NMR relaxation measurements. The IL studied has been specifically designed to dissolve a relatively large concentration of Na[NTf2] salt (over 2molkg(-1)) as this has been shown to improve ion transport and conductivity. Consistent with other studies, the measured ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficients show that the overall ionic mobility decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing salt content. NMR relaxation measurements provide evidence for correlated dynamics between the ether-functionalised ammonium and Na cations, possibly with the latter species acting as cross-links between multiple ammonium cations. Finally, preliminary cyclic voltammetry experiments show that this IL can undergo stable electrochemical cycling and could therefore be potentially useful as an electrolyte in a Na-based device.",8
"Using lithium metal as the negative electrode in a rechargeable lithium battery can increase the energy density, but to date, its use is limited due to uncontrolled and inhomogeneous electrodeposition upon cycling, leading to both low coulombic efficiencies and safety issues. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been identified as a key component in controlling microstructural growth but its role is still not well-understood. Here we explore the effect that fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), a common electrolyte additive, along with pulse plating, has on the SEI on lithium metal and the electrodeposition of lithium.In situNMR techniques, which are both non-invasive and quantitative, are used to monitor the microstructural growth during lithium deposition. We show how lithium whisker growth in a commercial carbonate electrolyte leads to increased SEI formation and low current efficiency, whereas using an FEC additive leads to denser lithium metal electrodeposits. We use(6,7)Li isotopic labelling to monitor the exchange between lithium metal and the electrolyte and develop a numerical model to describe the process, which is discussed in the context of the standard model of electrochemical kinetics. The model allows us both to extract an exchange current density at the open circuit voltage, which takes into account the growth of the SEI and allows the extent of Li metal corrosion to be quantified. The results demonstrate that the isotope exchange rate depends significantly on the electrolyte and the corresponding SEI. The numerical simulations show that with an FEC additive the exchange is twice as fast as without, which is attributed to faster lithium ion transport in the SEI. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that FEC results in an accelerated SEI formation rate, more than four times faster than without the additive. These beneficial SEI properties, namely the fast lithium transport and faster SEI formation, help to explain why the fluorinated FEC additive results in a more uniform lithium deposition. The fast lithium ion transport will lead to a more homogeneous current distribution at the electrode surface. In the event that the SEI layer is ruptured, passivation of the freshly exposed lithium will occur more rapidly further leading to more homogeneous deposition.",1
"The redox chemistry of magnesium and its application in rechargeable Mg batteries has received increasing attention owing to the unique benefits of Mg metal electrodes, namely high reversibility without dendrite formation, low reduction potentials, and high specific capacities. The Mg/S couple is of particular interest owing to its high energy density and low cost. Previous reports have confirmed the feasibility of a rechargeable Mg/S battery; however, only limited cycling stability was achieved, and the complicated procedure for the preparation of the electrolytes has significantly compromised the benefits of Mg/S chemistry and hindered the development of Mg/S batteries. Herein, we report the development of the first rechargeable Mg/S battery with a MgTFSI2/MgCl2/DME electrolyte (DME=1,2-dimethoxyethane, TFSI=bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) and realize the best cycling stability among all reported Mg/S batteries by suppressing polysulfide dissolution. Mechanistic studies show that the battery works via S0/MgSx redox processes and that the large voltage hysteresis is mainly due to the Mg anode overpotential.",14
"Mg metal is a promising anode material for next generation rechargeable battery due to its dendrite-free deposition and high capacity. However, the best cathode for rechargeable Mg battery was based on high molecular weight MgxMo3S4, thus rendering full cell energetically uncompetitive. To increase energy density, high capacity cathode material like sulfur is proposed. However, to date, only limited work has been reported on Mg/S system, all plagued by poor reversibility attributed to the formation of electrochemically inactive MgSx species. Here, we report a new strategy, based on the effect of Li+ in activating MgSx species, to conjugate a dendrite-free Mg anode with a reversible polysulfide cathode and present a truly reversible Mg/S battery with capacity up to 1000 mAh/gs for more than 30 cycles. Mechanistic insights supported by spectroscopic and microscopic characterization strongly suggest that the reversibility arises from chemical reactivation of MgSx by Li+.",14
"Magnesium–sulfur batteries are considered as attractive energy-storage devices due to the abundance of electrochemically active materials and high theoretical energy density. Here we report the mechanism of a Mg–S battery operation, which was studied in the presence of simple and commercially available salts dissolved in a mixture of glymes. The electrolyte offers high sulfur conversion into MgS in the first discharge with low polarization. The electrochemical conversion of sulfur with magnesium proceeds through two well-defined plateaus, which correspond to the equilibrium between sulfur and polysulfides (high-voltage plateau) and polysulfides and MgS (low-voltage plateau). As shown by XANES, RIXS (resonant inelastic X-ray scattering), and NMR studies, the end discharge phase involves MgS with Mg atoms in a tetrahedral environment resembling the wurtzite structure, while chemically synthesized MgS crystallizes in the rock-salt structure with octahedral coordination of magnesium.",14
"Mg-S batteries hold great promise as a potential alternative to Li-based technologies. Their further development hinges on solving a few key challenges, including the lower capacity and poorer cycling performance when compared to Li counterparts. At the heart of the issues is the lack of knowledge on polysulfide chemical behaviors in the Mg-S battery environment. In this Review, a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of polysulfide behaviors in Mg-S batteries is provided. First, a systematic summary of experimental and computational techniques for polysulfide characterization is provided. Next, conversion pathways for Mg polysulfide species within the battery environment are discussed, highlighting the important role of polysulfide solubility in determining reaction kinetics and overall battery performance. The focus then shifts to the negative effects of polysulfide shuttling on Mg-S batteries. The authors outline various strategies for achieving an optimal balance between polysulfide solubility and shuttling, including the use of electrolyte additives, polysulfide-trapping materials, and dual-functional catalysts. Based on the current understanding, the directions for further advancing knowledge of Mg polysulfide chemistry are identified, emphasizing the integration of experiment with computation as a powerful approach to accelerate the development of Mg-S battery technology.",14
"Pyridinium triflates are highly dissociated protic ionic liquids, and nonstoichiometric compositions have been used in protic energy devices such as the all-organic proton battery. Herein, we use a combination of pulsed field gradient NMR spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to investigate the charge transport properties of the nonstoichiometric protic ionic liquid 2-fluoropyridinium triflate and the variation with the acid-doping level. While all diffusion coefficients decreased with the level of acid doping, the room-temperature conductivity increased because of the concurrent increase in charge carrier concentration. The maximum room-temperature conductivity was 7.33 mS/cm, obtained when 14% of the pyridine was protonated with triflic acid, while higher acid-doping levels lead to liquid/solid mixtures with low conductivity. PEDOT supercapacitor cells with this electrolyte demonstrated very high capacitance (83.9 F/g) and charge storage capacity (23.3 mA h/g). In addition, we predict that using an acid-doping level lower than before will result in superior electrolyte performance in proton batteries because of improvements in conductivity, processability, and electrochemical stability.",16
"Combining molecular alignment with selective ion transport can increase the freedom to design ion-conducting polymeric materials and thus enhance applications such as battery electrolytes, fuel cells, and water purification. Here we employ pulsed-field-gradient (PFG) NMR diffusometry, H-2 NMR spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering to determine relations between counterion transport, dynamic coupling of water, and molecular alignment in aqueous solutions of a rigid rod sulfonated-aramid polyelectrolyte: poly(2,2'-disulfonyl-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT). Na-23 PFG NMR on PBDT solutions and simple sodium solutions shows significantly slower Na+ counterion diffusion in PBDT, providing agreement between counterion condensation theory and quantitative transport information. Strikingly, from H-2 NMR spectroscopy we observe that the orientational order parameter of partially aligned solvent D2O molecules increases linearly with polymer Weight percentage over a large concentration range (1.4 to 20 wt %), while the polymer chains possess essentially a large and fixed order parameter S-matrix = 0.76 as observed using both SAXS and H-2 NMR on labeled polymers. Finally, we apply a two-state model of water dynamics and a physical lattice model to quantitatively relate D2O spectral splittings and nematic rod-rod distance. These studies promise to open new pathways to understand a range of anisotropic polymer systems including aligned polymer electrolyte membranes, wood composites, aligned hydrogels, liquid crystals, and stretched elastomers.",0
"Previous studies have proven that using chemically crosslinked gels as a polymer host in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) has many advantages, including enhanced mechanical properties and high ion conductivity as two important factors in the efficiency of produced polymer electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Several studies have been conducted on the preparation of crosslinked polymer electrolytes and many crosslinking agents have been used. Meanwhile, dendrimers as attractive multifunctional structures can be used with some structural modifications as practical options for crosslinking of a polymeric host in GPEs. The use of such structures in the production of polymer networks can not only improve the mechanical properties but also enhance the stability and electrochemical properties of GPEs. In the present work, poly(amidoamine) dendrimers have been synthesized in different generations of 0.0GD to 4.0GD, and then each generation has been transformed into a multifunctional branched crosslinker through surface modification by acryloyl chloride and subsequently creating reactive vinyl groups. Then, the synthesized crosslinker dendrimers were introduced into the poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (poly(PEGMA)) matrix by in situ polymerization. The accuracy of synthesis in each step was proved through Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and H-1 NMR spectroscopies. Also, the synthesized poly(PEGMA) films were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Moreover, dynamic shear rheometry was utilized to investigate the rheological behavior of prepared gel polymers and confirm the formation of gel polymer membranes. The prepared GPEs presented excellent electrochemical properties, including high ionic conductivity on the order of 10(-2) S cm(-1), considerable transference number of 0.65, a wide electrochemical stability window of up to 5 V vs Li/Li+, and low interfacial resistance. Also, they showed excellent cycling performance and a high specific capacity of 185 mAh g(-1) in an LCO parallel to Li cell.",0
"Here, we report on the electrochemistry and transport of ions in mixtures of carbonates and an electroactive ionic liquid, in which lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfony1)imide (Li[NTf2]) is dissolved. The electroactive ionic liquid was obtained by linking a ferrocene moiety to the [NTf2](-), resulting in a redox anion (ferrocenylsulfonyl-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [FcNTf](-)) that can be used as a redox shuttle additive in Li-ion battery electrolytes. Electrochemical and transport properties of the [FcNTf](-) electroactive anion and of Li+ are investigated by ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and self-diffusion PFGSE NMR measurements. The study of the transport properties demonstrates the formation of solvated species and ion aggregation which affects the electrochemical behavior of the [FcNTf](-) anion. This study highlights that the fractional lithium ion and total ionic conductivity were significantly decreased with a high concentration of ionic liquid and lithium salt. Finally, the electroactive ionic liquid was applied in lithium-ion cells as a proof of concept of their use as redox shuttles.",0
"Mg batteries are attractive next-generation energy storage systems due to their high natural abundance, inexpensive cost, and high theoretical capacity compared to conventional Li-ion based systems. The high energy density is achieved by electrodeposition and stripping of a Mg metal anode and requires the development of effective electrolytes enabled by a mechanistic understanding of the charge-transfer mechanism. The magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte is a good model system to study the mechanism as the solution phase speciation is known. Previously, we reported that minor addition of Mg(HMDS)(2) to the MACC electrolyte causes significant improvement in the Mg deposition and stripping voltammetry resulting in good Coulombic efficiency on cycle one and, therefore, negating the need for electrochemical conditioning. To determine the cause of the improved electrochemistry, here we probe the speciation of the electrolyte after Mg(HMDS)(2) addition using Raman spectroscopy, Al-27 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and H-1-Si-29 heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy on MACC + Mg(HMDS)(2) at various Mg(HMDS)(2) concentrations. Mg(HMDS)(2) scavenges trace H2O, but it also reacts with MACC complexes, namely, AlCl4-, to form free CI-. We suggest that although both the removal of H2O and the formation of free Cl- improve electrochemistry by altering the speciation at the interface, the latter has a profound effect on electrodeposition and stripping of Mg.",10
"Lithium dendrite growth in lithium ion and lithium rechargeable batteries is associated with severe safety concerns. To overcome these problems, a fundamental understanding of the growth mechanism of dendrites under working conditions is needed. In this work, in situ Li-7 magnetic resonance (MRI) is performed on both the electrolyte and lithium metal electrodes in symmetric lithium cells, allowing the behavior of the electrolyte concentration gradient to be studied and correlated with the type and rate of microstructure growth on the Li metal electrode. For this purpose, chemical shift (CS) imaging of the metal electrodes is a particularly sensitive diagnostic method, enabling a clear distinction to be made between different types of microstructural growth occurring at the electrode surface and the eventual dendrite growth between the electrodes. The CS imaging shows that mossy types of microstructure grow close to the surface of the anode from the beginning of charge in every cell studied, while dendritic growth is triggered much later. Simple metrics have been developed to interpret the MRI data sets and to compare results from a series of cells charged at different current densities. The results show that at high charge rates, there is a strong correlation between the onset time of dendrite growth and the local depletion of the electrolyte at the surface of the electrode observed both experimentally and predicted theoretical (via the Sand's time model). A separate mechanism of dendrite growth is observed at low currents, which is not governed by salt depletion in the bulk liquid electrolyte. The MRI approach presented here allows the rate and nature of a process that occurs in the solid electrode to be correlated with the concentrations of components in the electrolyte.",0
"Lithium cation and anion diffusion constants (D-Li and D-Anion) are plotted versus ionic conductivity (sigma) (sigma-D relation) for lithium organic electrolyte solutions which are important to investigate Li secondary batteries. Lithium salts studied are LiPF6, LiBF4, LiN(SO2CF3)(2) (LiTFSA), LiN(SO2C2F5)(2) (LiBETI), LiC4BO8 (LiBOB), LiSO3CF3 and Li(2)B(12)F(1)2. Main organic solvents are propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), diethyl carbonate (DEC), four glymes and polyethylene glycol (PEG) dimethyl ethers of average molecular weights of 400 and 1,000. Mixing effects of two solvents are shown for EC-DEC-LiPF6 systems. In total, about 20 organic electrolyte solutions were studied. In addition, for six binary ionic liquid systems, sigma-D relations are plotted. Values for the degree of apparent ion dissociation (alpha) were calculated from the D-Li, D(Anio)n and s using the Nernst-Einstein (NE) relation and are plotted against sigma (sigma-alpha relation). The number of charge-carrying ions (Ncarrier) was estimated from the alpha and salt concentration, and plotted versus sigma (sigma-Ncarrier relation). To estimate the velocity of ions, the sigma-D solvent relations are plotted. Also, the apparent lithium transference number (t(Li)) obtained simply from the D-Li and D-anion values are plotted versus sigma (sigma-tLi relation). While we have already reported all the data in our previous papers, we did not plot directly the ion diffusion constants and other parameters versus ionic conductivity. In this paper, the importance of the direct relations of sigma-D, sigma-alpha, and sigma-Ncarrier is demonstrated to understand functions of lithium electrolyte solutions.The numerical data are freely available in Supplementary Information (SI), covering broad aspects of the fundamental and practical lithium electrolyte solution systems. We believe that they will contribute to the research and development for next generation Li battery systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Lithium metal is a promising anode material for Li-ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low potential. The growth of dendrites is a major barrier to the development of high capacity, rechargeable Li batteries with lithium metal anodes, and hence, significant efforts have been undertaken to develop new electrolytes and separator materials that can prevent this process or promote smooth deposits at the anode. Central to these goals, and to the task of understanding the conditions that initiate and propagate dendrite growth, is the development of analytical and nondestructive techniques that can be applied in situ to functioning batteries. MRI has recently been demonstrated to provide noninvasive imaging methodology that can detect and localize microstructure buildup. However, until now, monitoring dendrite growth by MRI has been limited to observing the relatively insensitive metal nucleus directly, thus restricting the temporal and spatial resolution and requiring special hardware and acquisition modes. Here, we present an alternative approach to detect a broad class of metallic dendrite growth via the dendrites' indirect effects on the surrounding electrolyte, allowing for the application of fast 3D 1H MRI experiments with high resolution. We use these experiments to reconstruct 3D images of growing Li dendrites from MRI, revealing details about the growth rate and fractal behavior. Radio-frequency and static magnetic field calculations are used alongside the images to quantify the amount of the growing structures.",0
"Identification of novel redox reactions that combine the prospects of high potential and capacity can contribute new opportunities in the development of advanced batteries with significantly higher energy density than today's state-of-the-art, while advancing current understanding of nonaqueous electrochemical transformations and reaction mechanisms. The immense research efforts directed in recent years toward metal gas, and in particular lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries, have highlighted the role that gas to-solid conversion reactions can play in future energy technologies; however, efforts have mainly focused on tailoring the anode (alkali metal) in the metal-gas couple to achieve improved reversibility. Here, in a different approach, we introduce and characterize a new gas cathode reaction that capitalizes on the full change in the oxidation state (from +6 to -2) available in redox-active sulfur, based on the cathodic reduction of highly fluorinated sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in a Li metal battery. In a glyme-based electrolyte (0.3 M LiClO4 in tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether), we establish, using quantitative gas and F-19 NMR analysis, that discharge predominantly involves an 8-electron reduction of SF6, yielding stoichiometric LiF, as well as Li2S and modest amounts of higher-order Li polysulfides. This multiphase conversion reaction yields capacities of similar to 3600 mA h g(c)(-1) at moderate rates (30 mA g(c)(-1)) and potentials up to 2.2 V versus Li/Li+. In a nonglyme electrolyte, 0.3 M LiClO4 in dimethyl sulfoxide, SF6 reduction also proceeds readily, yielding higher capacities of similar to 7800 mA h g(c)(-1) at 30 mA g(c)(-1). Although not at present rechargeable, the demonstration of, and insights gained, from the primary Li-SF6 system provides a promising first step for design of novel sulfur conversion chemistries with energy densities that exceed those of today's Li primary batteries, while demonstrating a new design space for nonaqueous gas-to-solid electrochemical reactions.",16
"Lithium-air batteries are a promising energy storage technology for transport applications, given their exceptionally high energy density. However, their development is significantly hampered by high overpotentials, which lead to poor efficiency and short lifetimes. Redox mediators provide a solution to this problem by shuttling electrons from the electrode to the active species at just above the redox potential of the mediator. Thus, knowing the redox potential and having the ability to tune it are critical to electrochemical performance. We focus on LiI as a model mediator-given its additional role in controlling LiOH vs Li2O2 chemistry-and use cyclic voltammetry (CV), NMR, UV/Vis spectrometry, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to monitor the effects of electrolyte composition on solvation. Li+ and I- solvation in common Li-air solvents, the electrochemical implications, and the applicability of each technique to probe the nature of the solvation shell and its effect on the electrochemical properties are explored. Starting with a simple thermodynamic model, we then used UV/Vis spectrometry to probe I- solvation, H-1 NMR spectroscopy to study water solvation and P-31 of the probe molecule triethylphosphine oxide (TEPO) to explore Li+ solvation; we find that no single descriptor can provide an accurate description of the solvation environment. Instead, we use all these methods in combination with the MD results to help rationalise the CV data. We find that the I- solvation improves significantly in tetraglyme (G4), with increasing salt and water concentration, but minimal effects on changing salt/water concentrations are seen in DMSO. In contrast, increasing salt concentration increases the Li+ activity in DMSO but not in G4. Furthermore, a simple model considering the equilibria between the different species was used to explain the H-1 NMR data.",3
"In this work, the distribution and dynamics of Li+ ions in p-CD-PEO/Li+ (p-CD, p-cyclodextrin; PEO, polyethylene-oxides) crystalline polymer electrolytes were investigated by solid-state NMR to enlighten the ionic conduction mechanism. Specifically, 7Li-6Li REDOR NMR and variable-contact-time 1H-6Li CP/ MAS NMR were adopted for the study. The results demonstrate that Li+ ions coordinated by polymer chains have relatively compact spatial density and fast dynamics, which facilitate the improvement of the electrochemical properties. Additionally, the variation of the distribution and dynamics of the Li+ ions and the ionic conduction mechanism were studied and discussed by altering the amount of the Li+ ions. This work deepens our understanding of the distribution and dynamics of Li+ ions in p-CD-PEO/Li+ crys-tals and demonstrates possible future applications of solid-state NMR on the study of the polymer electrolytes.

"A room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) of a quaternary ammonium cation having an ether chain, N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (DEME-TFSA), is a candidate for use as an electrolyte of lithium secondary batteries. In this study, the electrochemical ionic conductivity, a, of the neat DEME-TFSA and DEME-TFSA-Li doped with five different concentrations of lithium salt (LiTFSA) was measured and correlated with NMR measurements of the diffusion coefficients D and the spin-lattice relaxation times T, of the individual components DEME (H-1), TFSA (F-19), and lithium ion (Li-7). The ion conduction of charged ions can be activated with less thermal energy than ion diffusion which contains a contribution from paired ions in DEME-TFSA. In the doped DEME-TFSA-Li samples, the a and D values decreased with increasing salt concentration, and within the same sample generally D-Li < D-TFSA < D-DEME except for the sample having the lowest salt concentration at low temperatures. Since plots of the temperature dependence of T-1 of the H-1 and Li-7 resonances showed T, minima, the correlation times tau(c)(H) and tau(c)(Li) were calculated for reorientational motions of DEME and the lithium jump, respectively. At the same temperature, tau(c)(Li) is longer than tau(c)(H), suggesting that the molecular motion of DEME occurs more rapidly than the lithium jump. Combining the D-Li and tau(c)(Li), averaged distances for the lithium jump were estimated.",0
"A series of zwitterionic (ZI) copolymers, including both binary, fully-ZI and ternary, partially-ZI copolymer variations, have been successfully employed as scaffolds to support mechanically robust ionic liquid-based gel (ionogel) electrolytes containing sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt. All of the synthesized ionogels, which were optically transparent and freestanding without any covalent cross-links, contained 15 mol % copolymer and displayed room-temperature ionic conductivities above 1 mS cm(-1) while also exhibiting high compressive elastic modulus values (0.7-11 MPa). The activation energy of ionic conductivity of an ionogel with a fully-ZI copolymer scaffold (18 kJ mol(-1)) was found to be noticeably lower than that of the ionic liquid electrolyte solution itself (23 kJ mol(-1)), highlighting the positive role that ZI moieties may play in aiding ion transport. NMR chemical shift analysis revealed favorable interactions between sodium cations and both types of ZI motifs employed here (sulfobetaine and phosphorylcholine). In addition, the sodium-ion transference number value of a ternary copolymer-supported ionogel electrolyte was determined to be larger compared to that of the ionic liquid solution (0.19 vs 0.10, respectively).",8
"Ni-rich ternary oxides (LiNixCoyMnzO2, x + y + z = 1, x >= 0.6) has received growing attention due to its high reversible capacity and high working voltage. However, the practical application of Ni-rich cathodes is still obstructed by the serious interfacial instability and structural degradation during long-term cycling. In this work, we propose a novel cyclic siloxane additive, i.e. 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-disila-1-oxacyclopentane (TMDSi). With this additive, the capacity retention of NCM90||Li cells can be improved to 85% after 200 cycles at 1C (1C = 180 mA g-1). The working mechanism of this novel additive has been clearly disclosed with the help of scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and liquid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The results show that TMDSi can effectively scavenge HF and suppress the dissolution of transition metal ions from the NCM90 cathode. Furthermore, its decomposition products can also form a uniform protective CEI film on the surface of NCM90 particles to maintain the complete morphology and reduce parasitic side reactions at the cathode interface. This bifunctional working mechanism makes TMDSi a promising electrolyte additive for Ni-rich cathode in Li-ion batteries.",0
"A soluble polyimide (PI) is attempted to be a binder for transition metal oxide cathode in lithium ion batteries. It is synthesized from 2,2-Bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]propane, 4,4'-Oxydianiline and 4,4'-Oxydiphthalic anhydride, and characterized by FT-IR and H-1 NMR techniques. To be a binder, the synthesized PI is applied to fabricate the electrodes, showing binding property and electrochemical performance as good as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) that is conventional binder widely used in lithium ion batteries. The 2 Ah pouch full cells with PI and PVDF binders are assembled to compare their performances. As a result, the batteries with PI binder display 91.4% capacity retention after 500 cycles, which is almost the same as the cells withPVDF binder. The overcharge safetytests are carried by 2 Ah pouch full cells, indicating that PI cells can pass the test, no fire and no explosion, but the PVDF cells fail the test, catching fire. The result shows that the PI binder can enhance the safety of Li-ion batteries. This study paves a new way to improve the safety performance of lithium ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The temperature dependence of density, viscosity, ionic conductivity (AC impedance method) and self-diffusion coefficient (pulsed-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance) was measured.

"The rational design of electrolytes has been a long-standing challenge in chemistry and materials science. In this work, we demonstrate a computational rationale for improving the performance of weakly coordinating electrolytes in currently challenging multivalent-ion battery applications, based on enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stability against reductive decomposition. A series of fluorinated alkoxyborate and alkoxyaluminate salts are systematically examined based on their reduction and oxidation potentials and, motivated by NMR spectroscopy, detailed reductive decomposition pathways involv-ing the breaking of Al/B-O, C-O, or C-F bonds are obtained. Based on the decomposition kinetics, the hexafluoro-tert-isopropoxy (hfip) ligand for borates and the trifluoro-tert-butoxy (tftb) ligand for aluminates are identified as promising ligands for constructing the salt anions. This borate prediction corroborates previous experimental work on Mg[B(hfip)4]2 and Ca[B(hfip)4]2, in which excellent electrochemical properties were reported. We find that steric factors govern the B-O bond-breaking decomposition kinetics while electronic factors are more important for aluminate salts. There is more charge transfer character in the aluminate transition states compared with borates for Al/B-O bond-breaking decomposition and thus electron-withdrawing ligands tend to stabilize the aluminate transition states. Such molecular-level understandings allow for better design principles for developing new electrolytes with improved stability and performance.",15
"Solid-state O-17 NMR was used to compare the stability of two potential Li-O-2 electrolytes tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) and trimethyl phosphate (TMP). The TEGDME electrolyte demonstrated superior stability to the TMP electrolyte. Li2O2 and evidence of electrolyte breakdown was observed in the TEGDME cell, whereas only electrolyte breakdown products were discovered within the TMP cell. Potential decomposition pathways of TMP are proposed here that account for the formation of the discharge species observed in the O-17, Li-7, H-1, and P-31 solid-state NMR of the cycled cathodes.",3
"Electrical double-layer capacitors bring numerous strengths to the energy storage landscape but have limited use due to their high unit energy cost and low specific energy. Water-in-salt electrolytes have been recently purported as an option to provide more affordable energy storage, but high viscosity and limited conductivity hinder their direct use in high-power devices such as capacitors. By using solid-state NMR and electrolyte-tuned porosity carbons, we demonstrate, at the molecular level, a drastic impact of relative pore/ion size on proper electrolyte propagation deep down the pore volume. The NMR results also provide a rationale for the radical changes in low-and high-rate electrochemical response observed using carbons with differently nanosized pores and a water-in-salt electrolyte.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

"In dual-ion batteries (DIBs), it is a key issue to search for electrolyte solutions compatible with graphite positive electrode. The solutions of LiPF6 dissolved in short chain esters like ethyl methyl carbonate or methyl propionate have emerged as suitable choices, in which graphite positive electrode can deliver a PF6- storage capacity about 100 mA h g(-1). However, in a much shorter chain ester, methyl acetate (MA), the PF6- storage capacity delivered by graphite electrode is limited to 60 mA h g(-1). In this paper, the flame-retardant solvent of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) is introduced into LiPF6-MA solutions to improve the electrochemical performance of graphite electrode. The reversible capacity can be enhanced to near 90 mA h g(-1) in 3 M LiPF6-MA/TMP (6:4 by vol.). Traditional electrochemical tests in combination with ex situ/in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations have been applied to probe the charge storage mechanism across the interfaces between graphite electrode and electrolyte solutions.

"Aqueous zinc batteries are attracting interest because of their potential for cost-effective and safe electricity storage. However, metallic zinc exhibits only moderate reversibility in aqueous electrolytes. To circumvent this issue, we study aqueous Zn batteries able to form nanometric interphases at the Zn metal/liquid electrolyte interface, composed of an ion-oligomer complex. In Zn||Zn symmetric cell studies, we report highly reversible cycling at high current densities and capacities (e.g., 160 mA cm(-2); 2.6 mAh cm(-2)). By means of quartz-crystal microbalance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and voltammetry measurements we show that the interphase film exists in a dynamic equilibrium with oligomers dissolved in the electrolyte. The interphase strategy is applied to aqueous Zn||I-2 and Zn||MnO2 cells that are charged/discharged for 12,000 cycles and 1000 cycles, respectively, at a current density of 160 mA cm(-2) and capacity of approximately 0.85 mAh cm(-2). Finally, we demonstrate that Zn||I-2-carbon pouch cells (9 cm(2) area) cycle stably and deliver a specific energy of 151 Wh/kg (based on the total mass of active materials in the electrode) at a charge current density of 56 mA cm(-2).Aqueous zinc batteries attract interest because of their potential for cost-effective and safe electricity storage.

"The ion-transport properties of composite electrolytes composed of oligomers of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether, hydrophobic fumed silica, and Li(CF3SO2)(2)N (LiTFSI) are investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrophoretic NMR (ENMR), ac impedance spectroscopy, and rheology. The effects of fumed silica and salt concentration on ionic conductivity, diffusivity of ions and oligomers, and lithium transference number (T-Li) are examined at 30degreesC. The fumed silica forms a self-supporting network with large pores such that the network, regardless of silica concentration, has little effect on ion-transport characteristics. Examination of the effect of salt on ion transport reveals a maximum ionic conductivity at around 1.06 M, which is attributed to a tradeoff of adding more charge carriers balanced against increased ion-ion interactions and reduced mobilities. T-Li with respect to salt concentration surprisingly passes through a minimum around 0.35 M. The increase in T-Li at higher concentrations is attributed to the mobilities of cations, anions, and solvating oligomer becoming constrained to the same value due to loss of free volume. The values of T-Li at low salt concentrations (<0.35 M) are attributed to the ions existing in either a fully dissociated state or primarily as charged complexes. Results of T-Li from ENMR and from estimation via pulse field gradient NMR (pfg-NMR) are compared showing that pfg-NMR consistently overestimates T-Li. Finally, a comparison is presented of measured conductivity with that calculated from the Nernst-Einstein equation and diffusivities found from pfg-NMR measurement; we discuss possible reasons why it is inappropriate to estimate ion-pair formation by this comparison.

"The cell performance of Li-S batteries can be improved by establishing compatibility with the electrolyte of cathode and enhancing lithium-ion diffusion (ionic conductivity) or electrical conductivity. In this work, we introduce cathode material based on ethylene glycol-containing acrylic polyphosphazene. Poly[(2acrylamidoethoxy)-random-(methoxyethoxyethoxy)] phosphazenes were synthesized by macromolecular substitution of poly(dichloro)phosphazene with 2-acrylamidoethanol and diethylene glycol methyl ether in two different ratios (25 and 50 mol% of ethylene glycol methyl ether), abbreviated as MP-25EG and MP-50EG, where ethylene glycol chains enhance the electrolyte compatibility and ion transport of the sulfur cathode material. Then, poly[S-random-(2acrylamidoethoxy)-random-(methoxyethoxyethoxy)] phosphazene polymers, designated as MP-25EG-xS or MP-50EG-xS (x=50 and 80 wt.% of sulfur) were prepared by inverse vulcanization of polymer with two feed sulfur ratios. Structural characterizations of the polymers were carried out using appropriate standard spectroscopic methods such as H-1 and P-31 NMR, FT-IR, DSC and TGA as well as XPS. The electrochemical performance of MP-25EG-50S, MP-25EG-80S and MP-50EG-50S, MP-50EG-80S were evaluated and the effect of ethylene glycol was investigated by comparing cell performances.

"First-principles calculations are performed to gain fundamental understanding of recently developed Al/graphite battery that exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus, high cycling stability, and ultrafast rate performance. Crucial issues pertaining to the unprecedented performance of the battery are understood, and key controversies in literature with respect to the geometry and gallery height of the intercalant are resolved. The stage and atomic structure of the graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are elucidated, in line with the experimental finding. It is revealed that the intercalants tend to be inserted at relative high densities with a charging potential profile and theoretical specific capacity that agree well with the experiment. Four stable GIC configurations are identified with essentially the same chemical potential for the intercalant, giving rise to charging potential plateaus. Low diffusion energy barriers of the intercalants are found, which underlie the ultrafast (dis)charging rates of the battery.",5
"Constructing ordered hierarchical porous structures while maintaining their overall crystalline order is highly desirable but remains an arduous challenge. Herein, we successfully achieve the growth of single-crystalline metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in three-dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous template voids by a saturated solution-based double-solvent-assisted strategy with precise control over the nucleation process. The as-prepared single-crystalline ordered macro–microporous Co-based MOFs (SOM ZIF-67) exhibit an ordered macro–microporous structure with robust single-crystalline nature. Moreover, SOM ZIF-67 can serve as a precursor to derive 3D-ordered macroporous cobalt diselenide@carbon (3DOM CoSe2@C) through a facile carbonization–selenization treatment. The as-derived 3DOM CoSe2@C can well preserve the 3D-ordered macroporous structure of the precursor. More importantly, CoSe2 nanoparticles could be uniformly confined in the conductive ordered macroporous carbon framework, affording regularly interconnected macroporous channels and large surface area. As a result, when evaluated as a cathode material for aluminum-ion batteries, the ordered macroporous structure could not only effectively facilitate the diffusion of large-sized chloroaluminate anions but also increase the contact area with electrolyte and provide more exposed active sites, thereby exhibiting superior reversible rate capacity (86 mA h g–1 at 5.0 A g–1) and remarkable cycling performance (125 mA h g–1 after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g–1).",5

"Aluminum–sulfur (Al−S) batteries of ultrahigh energy-to-price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst-boosting quasi-solid-state Al−S battery, which involves a sulfur-anchored cobalt/nitrogen co-doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic-liquid-impregnated metal–organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co−N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al−Cl and S−S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al−S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43 V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9 V. In the quasi-solid-state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al−S battery to deliver 820 mAh g−1 specific capacity and 78 % capacity retention after 300 cycles.

"Fast ion transport is essential for high rate capability in rechargeable battery operation. Recently, an ultrafast rechargeable aluminum-ion battery was experimentally demonstrated through the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of chloroaluminate anions (AlCl4–) in graphitic-foam cathodes. Using first-principles calculations, herein, we report that the unique structural characteristic of graphitic foam, i.e., mechanical flexibility of few-layered graphene nanomaterials, plays a key role for the ultrafast aluminum-ion battery. We found that AlCl4– is stored by forming doubly stacked ionic layers in the interlayer space between graphene sheets, and their diffusivity increases dramatically once graphene film is less than five layers thick; the diffusivity begins to increase when the film thickness reduces below five layers in such a way that the film thickness of four, three, and two graphene layers enables 48, 153, and 225 times enhanced diffusivity than that of the bulk graphite, respectively, and this nanoscale thickness is mainly responsible for the observed ultrafast rate capability of graphitic foam. The faster anion conductivity with the reduced film thickness is attributed to high elasticity of few-layered graphene, providing more space for facile AlCl4– diffusion. This study indicates that even bulky polyanions can be adopted as carrier ions for ultrahigh rate operation if highly elastic few-layered graphene is used as an active material.",5

"Aluminium-ion batteries (AIB) are very attractive energy storage systems due to the high availability and theoretical energy density of metallic aluminium. However, the practical performance of AIBs in AlCl3-based electrolytes is limited by the low reversible capacity of the positive graphite electrode for large AlCl4- anions. Moreover, the use of high energy oxide-based electrodes such as MnO2 requires the presence of positively charged aluminium complexes in the electrolyte. In this work, the coordination of Al complexes in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) composed of Al triflate Al(TfO)(3) as the conducting salt, urea and/or acetamide as the hydrogen bond donor and formamide and N-methylacetamide as the solvent was investigated. Both solvents were able to dissolve and dissociate Al(TfO)(3) principally to a single positively charged Al complex [Al(TfO)(2)-solvent(n)](+) which was confirmed by Raman and NMR spectroscopy analyses. Furthermore, the addition of urea led to further dissociation to the [AlTfO-solvent(n)-urea(2)](2+) complex that can be assigned to the bidentate hydrogen bonding of urea with TfO at a specific ratio of urea/Al(TfO)(3) of 4 : 1. Because of their partial miscibility with urea, other conventional solvents such as propylene carbonate and acetonitrile dissociate Al(TfO)(3) only once to form [AlTfO2-solvent(n)](+). The as-prepared formamide and N-methylacetamide-based DES electrolytes show good conductivity values of 9.65 and 2.45 mS cm(-1), respectively.",5
"Lithium–air batteries (LABs) have attracted tremendous attention since the proposal of the LAB concept in 1996 because LABs have a super high theoretical/practical specific energy and an infinite supply of redox-active materials, and are environment-friendly. However, due to the lack of critical electrode materials and a thorough understanding of the chemistry of LABs, the development of LABs entered a germination period before 2010, when LABs research mainly focused on the development of air cathodes and carbonate-based electrolytes. In the growing period, i.e., from 2010 to the present, the investigation focused more on systematic electrode design, fabrication, and modification, as well as the comprehensive selection of electrolyte components. Nevertheless, over the past 25 years, the development of LABs has been full of retrospective steps and breakthroughs. In this review, the evolution of LABs is illustrated along with the constantly emerging design, fabrication, modification, and optimization strategies. At the end, perspectives and strategies are put forward for the development of future LABs and even other metal–air batteries.",3
"Wide adaptation of intermittent renewable energies into the power grid and more affordable electric vehicles cannot be realized without low-cost, high-energy, and long-life energy storage systems. Using lithium, the lightest metal, and ubiquitous O2 in the air as active materials, lithium-air (Li-air) batteries promise up to 5-fold higher specific energy than current Li-ion batteries at a lower cost. However, the Li-air technology is still in its infancy, and its development has been challenged by severe instability originating from the high reactivities of various oxygenated species. Over the past decade, much effort has been devoted to fundamental mechanistic studies, leading to substantial improvement in the reversibility of Li-air batteries. Meanwhile, relatively less attention has been focused on demonstrating practical performance and realizing the promised high specific energy. In this perspective, we identify four critical ongoing challenges to achieving practical Li-air batteries: improving positive electrode reversibility with high precision quantification of side reactions, achieving high specific capacity and rate capability at pouch cell level or above, developing open systems in atmospheric air, and stabilizing the Li metal negative electrode. We discuss the state-of-the-art progress and highlight future developments needed for achieving practical Li-air batteries and their future commercialization.",3
"Lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries have been intensively investigated in recent decades for their utilization in electric vehicles. The intrinsic challenges arising from O2 (electro)chemistry have been mitigated by developing various types of catalysts, porous electrode materials, and stable electrolyte solutions. At the next stage, we face the need to reform batteries by substituting pure O2 gas with air from Earth’s atmosphere. Thus, the key emerging challenges of Li–air batteries, which are related to the selective filtration of O2 gas from air and the suppression of undesired reactions with other constituents in air, such as N2, water vapor (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2), should be properly addressed. In this review, we discuss all key aspects for developing Li–air batteries that are optimized for operating in ambient air and highlight the crucial considerations and perspectives for future air-breathing batteries.",3
"Rechargeable lithium-air batteries have ultra-high theoretical capacities and energy densities, allowing them to be considered as one of the most promising power sources for next-generation electric vehicles. The technology has been honed in various ways over the years, but it still experiences critical issues that need to be addressed in order to make it commercially viable. For instance, its practical capacity, round-trip efficiency, and cycling life are among the factors that need to be improved. In this review, the developments of this type of battery are presented. In particular, the system levels of design that encompass the optimization of the battery’s electrolyte and electrodes are discussed. More importantly, this report provides perspectives on achieving the desired battery performance to meet the demands of commercial viability.",3
"Li–air batteries have potential to be the next generation power sources for various applications, from portable devices to electric vehicles and microgrids, due largely to their significantly higher theoretical energy densities than those of the existing batteries. The commercialization of this technology, however, is hindered by a variety of technical hurdles, including low obtainable capacity, poor energy efficiency, and limited cycle life. Breakthrough to these barriers requires a fundamental understanding of the complex electrochemical and transport behaviors inside the batteries. Mathematical modeling and simulation are imperative in gaining important insight into the mechanisms of these complex phenomena, which is vital to achieving rational designs of better materials for high-performance batteries. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the latest advances in modeling and simulation of Li–air batteries and offer our perspectives on new directions of future development. Unlike previous reviews that centered mainly on continuum modeling of non-aqueous Li–air batteries, the present paper focuses on mathematical descriptions of the detailed transport and electrochemical processes in different types of Li–air batteries. We start with a brief introduction to the working principles of Li–air batteries. Then, the governing equations for mass transport and electrochemical reactions in non-aqueous Li–air batteries are formulated, including lithium ion and oxygen transport in the porous air electrode, the formation of solid discharge products, the kinetics of electrode reactions, the evolution of electrode structure, the distribution of active sites, the effect of the side reactions during cycling, the phenomena of the volume change, and the charge process. In addition, the mo\deling and simulations of aqueous and hybrid Li–air batteries are reviewed, highlighting the phenomena that are different from those in the non-aqueous ones. Finally, the challenges facing the modeling and simulation of Li–air batteries are discussed and perspectives for the development of a new generation of Li–air batteries are outlined.",3
"Electrolytes based on bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) with a range of LiFSI salt concentrations were characterized using physical property measurements, as well as NMR, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. Different from the behavior at lower concentrations, the FSI electrolyte containing 1:1 salt to IL mole ratio showed less deviation from the KCl line in the Walden plot, suggesting greater ionic dissociation. Diffusion measurements show higher mobility of lithium ions compared to the other ions, which suggests that the partial conductivity of Li+ is higher at this higher composition. Changes in the FT-IR and Raman peaks indicate that the cis-FSI conformation is preferred with increasing Li salt concentration.",16
"Li-O2 battery possesses simple structure and high specific energy, and thus is one of the promising battery systems for future application in energy storage. In order to overcome the performance deficiencies and realize the practical utilization of Li-O2 battery, substantial efforts and significant progress has been made in recent years. In this review, we will mainly focus on the key problems that may result in the performance deficiency of Li-O2 battery and survey the studies reported in the literature that provide solutions to these problems. The development trend and prospect of Li-O2 battery are also discussed.",3
"A physics-based model is proposed for the simulation of Li-air batteries. The model is carefully calibrated against published data and is used to simulate standard Li-air batteries with a nonaqueous (organic) electrolyte. The specific capacity is mainly limited by the oxygen diffusion length, which is a function of the oxygen diffusivity in the electrolyte and the discharge current density. Various approaches to increase the specific capacity of the cathode electrode and the energy density of Li-air batteries are discussed. To increase the specific capacity and energy density, it is more efficient to use a nonuniform catalyst that enhances the reaction rate only at the separator–cathode interface than a catalyst uniformly distributed. Using uniformly distributed catalysts enhances the current and power density of the cell but does not increase significantly the specific capacity and energy density. The specific capacity and energy density can be increased by suppressing the reaction rate at the oxygen–entrance interface to delay the pinch-off of the conduction channel in this region. Other possibilities to enhance the energy density such as using solvents with high oxygen solubility and diffusivity and partly wetted electrodes are discussed.",3
"We report the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of polycrystalline palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, and glassy carbon surfaces in 0.1 M LiClO4 1,2-dimethoxyethane via rotating disk electrode measurements. The nonaqueous Li+-ORR activity of these surfaces primarily correlates to oxygen adsorption energy, forming a “volcano-type” trend. The activity trend found on the polycrystalline surfaces was in good agreement with the trend in the discharge voltage of Li-O2 cells catalyzed by nanoparticle catalysts. Our findings provide insights into Li+-ORR mechanisms in nonaqueous media and design of efficient air electrodes for Li-air battery applications.",3
"Li/S and Li/air cells have attracted much recent attention as potential successors to lithium ion batteries because of their exceptionally high energy density compared with current battery technology. Although the two new battery systems have the potential to satisfy the demand for a significant leap forward in energy storage technology, there remain significant problems to be addressed, including poor cycle stability and low rate capability for practical applications. To address these issues, much research effort has been invested. In particular, graphene, with its high surface area combined with catalytic properties, is considered to be a key potential material to advance Li/S and Li/air battery technology. Indeed, recent research into graphene has led to substantial performance improvements of Li/S and Li/air batteries. In this review, we describe recent achievements in Li/S and Li/air cells that have been facilitated by the application of graphene, together with the electrochemical reaction mechanisms and major issues facing both Li/S and Li/air batteries.",3
"A polymerizable anion receptor based on a boric acid ester was synthesized. When the anion receptor was added to different electrolyte solutions consisting of an aprotic solvent and a lithium salt, the ionic conductivity of certain electrolyte solutions, composed of low polar solvents or salts with low dissociation abilities, was enhanced appreciably. Viscosity measurements for the electrolyte solutions, with and without the added anion receptor, indicated that the conductivity enhancement was caused by an increase in the ionic dissociation due to the addition of the anion receptor. Pulse-field-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR and B-11-NMR spectra supported that the ionic dissociation was facilitated by interaction between the Lewis-acidic anion receptor and Lewis-basic anions. The polymerizable anion receptor was crosslinked with a polyether macromonomer in different electrolyte solutions. Ionic conductivity of the resulting polymer gel electrolytes was also altered like that of the electrolyte solutions containing the anion receptor monomer. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Aluminum ion battery (AIB) technology is an exciting alternative for post-lithium energy storage. AIBs based on ionic liquids have enabled advances in both cathode material development and fundamental understanding on mechanisms. Recently, unlocking chemistry in rechargeable aqueous aluminum ion battery (AAIB) provides impressive prospects in terms of kinetics, cost, safety considerations, and ease of operation. To review the progress on AAIB, we discuss the critical issues on aluminum electrochemistry in aqueous system, cathode material design to overcome the drawbacks by multivalent aluminum ions, and challenges on electrolyte design, aluminum stripping/plating, solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) formation, and design of cathode materials. This review aims to stimulate exploration of high-performance AAIB and rationalize feasibility grounded on underlying reaction mechanisms.",5
"A new Al-ion battery based on an affordable and nontoxic liquid electrolyte made from molten AlCl3/urea was assembled. As the cathode material, natural graphite shows two well-defined discharge voltage plateaus at about 1.9 and 1.5 V with a high specific capacity of 93 mA h g−1 and excellent coulombic efficiency (>99%). The attractive capacity (about 78 mA h g−1) is retained even at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1. Moreover, no faster fading in capacity is observed after 500 cycles. This electrolyte could provide a new system for Al ion batteries, which can be used for large scale energy storage, owing to its cost advantages, high-rate capability and durability.",5
"Aqueous aluminium-ion rechargeable batteries (AAIBs) have attracted lots of attention due to their high theoretical capacity, high volumetric energy density and low price. However, not many aqueous full batteries have been developed successfully due to the low standard reduction potential of Al3+ (−1.68 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, lower than H+) in aqueous solutions. In this study, we highlight an inexpensive “water-in-salt” aqueous electrolyte (AlCl3·6H2O) that can expand the electrochemical stability window of AAIBs to roughly 4 V. We propose a full aluminum-ion battery (AIB) using such an aqueous electrolyte. Its capacity reached 165 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 (3C), and it exhibited over 95% coulombic efficiency consistently over 1000 cycles. Moreover, the aqueous Al-ion battery we developed is low-cost (the electrolyte is roughly 2% the cost of traditional electrolyte of Al-ion batteries) and dendrite-free in the negative electrode throughout the tests.",9
"The Li3VO4@C microsphere composite was first reported as a novel cathode material for rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), which manifests the initial discharge capacity of 137 mAh g–1 and and remains at 48 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The detailed intercalation mechanism of Al into the orthorhombic Li3VO4 is investigated by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Li3VO4@C electrodes and the nuclear magnetic resonance aluminum spectroscopy (27Al NMR) of ionic liquid electrolytes in different discharge/charge states. First-principle calculations are also carried out to investigate the structural change as Al inserts into the framework of Li3VO4. It is revealed that the Al/Li3VO4@C battery goes through electrochemical dissolution and deposition of metallic aluminum in the anode, as well as the insertion and deinsertion of Al3+ cations in the cathode in the meantime. The rechargeable AIBs fabricated in this work are of low cost and high safety, which may make a step forward in the development of novel cathode materials based on the acidic ionic liquid electrolyte system.",5
"Recently, with large-scale energy storage equipment gradually becoming the research hotspot in the field of electrochemistry, rechargeable aluminium ion batteries (AIBs) have been described as the most promising candidate to substitute for well-developed lithium ion batteries due to their advantages of cost-effectiveness, favorable security and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, owing to the inherent gap between theoretical experiments and commercial applications, the storage capacity, battery potential and energy density need to be improved to a large degree. In this regard, attention should be paid to two crucial factors impacting the electrochemical performance, that is the positive electrode materials and electrolytes. Therefore, this review is focused on a variety of positive electrode materials, such as transition metal oxides, metal sulfides, carbonaceous materials and other types of materials based on two main electrolyte systems, i.e., the organic system and the aqueous system. In this paper, not only is the working intercalation mechanism comprehensively concluded, but the results of relevant electrochemical experiments for AIBs are also compared and analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of improving rechargeable AIBs are also proposed.",5
"The development of new rechargeable safe battery with high energy density and low cost is one of the most desirable goals for personal electronics and grid storage. Aluminum based rechargeable ion batteries offer the possibilities for safe, high energy density and low cost. Here, we developed a novel aluminum based high-rate capability dual-ion battery with an aluminum anode and a 3D graphene cathode. The battery operated through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminum at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of ClO4- anions in the graphene based cathode with a new Al(ClO4)3/Propylene carbonate - Fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte. The battery exhibited high discharge voltage plateaus (about 1 V), high-rate capacity (101 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1) and long cycle life (more than 400 cycles). More importantly, the battery also showed superior electrochemical properties with fast charge and slow discharge (the battery could be fully charged in 13 min and discharged for more than 73 min). And the reaction mechanisms of the aluminum based dual-ion battery is also proposed and discussed in detail.",5
"The aluminum-ion battery is a very promising rechargeable battery system for its high-power-density and three-electron-redox aluminum anode. Currently, the aluminum-ion battery is mainly composed of aluminum anode and graphitic cathode, separated by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIC)-based ionic liquid electrolyte. Despite of the progress made for cathode materials, its practical application is severely restricted by the high cost and low productivity of EMIC. Here we report a low-cost AlCl3/Et3NHCl room temperature ionic liquid electrolyte to fabricate practical yet high-performance Al-graphene battery. The battery shows 112 mAh g-1 cathodic capacity with 97.3% retention after 30,000 cycles and 84% retention even after an ultrahigh current density at 18 A g-1 (150 C, charged in 18 second). In this battery, electrochemical deposition/dissolution of aluminum at the anode while intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphene cathode take place during charge-discharge. The formation of a stage 3 graphene intercalation compound at fully charged state is confirmed. This pragmatic and cost-effective AlCl3/Et3NHCl room temperature ionic liquid grants the aluminum-ion battery with high performance and higher practical value.",5
"The self-association of n-hexyltrimethylammonium bromide (C(6)TAB) in aqueous solution has been studied by static and dynamic light scattering and NMR spectroscopy at 25 degreesC in the presence of added electrolyte, and critical aggregation concentrations, aggregation numbers and the degree of ionization have been calculated. Aggregation numbers determined from light scattering and from the application of mass-action theory to the concentration dependence of H-1 NMR chemical shifts of four protons along the alkyl chain of C(6)TAB, were between three and four over the range of electrolyte concentration studied (0.2-0.7 molkg(-1) NaBr). A structure for the small aggregates has been proposed from the NMR chemical shift data.",8
"Sodium (Na) metal, which possesses a high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrochemical potential, is regarded as a promising anode material for Na-metal batteries. However, both Na dendrite growth and large volume change in cycling have severely impeded its practical applications. This study demonstrates that a 3D flexible carbon (C) felt which is already commercialized in large-scale can be employed as a host for prestoring Na via a melt infusion strategy, through which a Na/C composite anode is obtained. The resulting anode exhibits a stable voltage profile and a small hysteresis over 120 cycles in carbonate-based electrolytes in symmetrical cells owing to the fact that the metallic Na is confined in a conductive carbon felt host, which increases the Na+ deposition sites to lower the effective current density and render a uniform Na nucleation, restricting the dimension change in electrochemical cycling. More importantly, effective inhibition of Na dendrite growth and large volume change is achieved. When coupled with a Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode, the Na/C composite demonstrates a good suitability in full cells. This work provides an alternative option for the fabrication of stable Na metal anodes, which is of great significance for the practical applications of Na metal anodes in high-energy-density batteries.",0
"Electrolytes based on lithium oligoether sulfate, and dissolved in liquid or polymer solvents, are studied. Their properties in term of ionic conductivities, transference numbers, diffusion coefficients, and electrochemical stabilities are reported. The comparison between NMR and electrochemical data, that is, transference numbers and conductivities, provides important information about the existence of ion pairs and aggregates. A fairly good agreement can be noticed between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies and the stability of the salts towards oxidation in relation with the length of the oligoether tail.",16
"Choline-based electrolytes have been proposed as environmentally friendly and low-cost alternatives for secondary zinc air batteries. Choline acetate [Ch](+)[OAc](-) in protic (D2O) and aprotic (DMSO-d(6)) solvents has been studied by means of concentration-dependent H-1 NMR, viscosity, and density measurements. The viscosities have been calculated on the basis of the Jones-Dole equation and showed that the dominant contribution originates from short-range ion-solvent interactions. Site-specific association affinities were assigned from NMR chemical shift titrations. In DMSO-d(6), the hydroxyl group of choline was found to have the smallest dissociation constant followed by the methyl group of acetate. The corresponding Gibbs energies at low concentration were found to be in agreement with a solvent-separated ion pair (2SIP) configuration, whereas at concentrations above 300 mM, a solvent-shared ion pair (SIP) configuration was assigned. For [Ch](+)[OAc](-) in D2O, association effects were found to be weaker, attributed to the high dielectric constant of the solvent. On time scales on the order of 100 ms, NMR linewidth perturbations indicated a change in the local rotational dynamics of the ions, attributed to short-range cation-solvent interactions and not to solvent viscosity. At 184 mM, similar to 40 % of the cations in DMSO-d(6) and similar to 10 % in D2O were found to exhibit short-range interactions, as indicated by the linewidth perturbations. It was found that at about 300 mM, the ions in DMSO-d(6) exhibit a transition from free to collective translational dynamics on time scales on the order of 400 ms. In DMSO-d(6), both ions were found to be almost equally solvated, whereas in D2O solvation of acetate was stronger, as indicated by the obtained effective hydrodynamic radii. For [Ch](+)[OAc](-) in DMSO-d(6), the results suggest a solvent-shared ion association with weak H-bonding interactions for concentrations between 0.3-1 M. Overall, the extent of ion association in solvents such as DMSO is not expected to significantly limit charge transport and hinder the performance of choline-based electrolytes.",0
"Besides commercially available synthetic polymers, the present work has been undertaken to explore the significance of poly(glycerol suberate) (PGS) polyester synthesised under lab scale in energy storage device. In this regard, a blend polymer electrolyte comprising of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(glycerol suberate) (PGS) polyester along with the various proportions of ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) was prepared adopting solution casting technique. The synthesised polyester PGS was characterised by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The prepared electrolyte film was subjected to FT-IR analysis to study the complexation that has occurred within the blend. Its amorphous nature was revealed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Influence of NH4SCN on the glass transition temperature (T (g)) was drawn from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The dispersion of dopant within the polymer matrix was supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) followed by its elemental composition from energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). From the AC impedance technique, maximum conductivity of 3.01 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) was elicited for the optimised electrolyte (1 g PVA + 0.75 g PGS + 0.6 g NH4SCN). Frequency-dependent dielectric and modulus spectra were analysed to study the mechanism of transportation. Transport parameters evaluated by Wagner's polarisation method proved that the conductivity was predominantly due to cations. Proton conducting battery was configured with the highest conducting electrolytic film and its cell parameters are presented.",0
"The Li(+)transference number of electrolytes is one of the key factors contributing to the enhancement in the charge-discharge performance of Li secondary batteries. However, a design principle to achieve a high Li(+)transference number has not been established for liquid electrolytes. To understand the factors governing the Li(+)transference numbert(Li), we investigated the influence of the ion-solvent interactions, Li ion coordination, and correlations of ion motions on the Li(+)transference number in glyme (Gn,n= 1-4)- and sulfolane (SL)-based molten Li salt solvate electrolytes with lithium bis(trifluoromethansulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA). For the 1 : 1 tetraglyme-LiTFSA molten complex, [Li(G4)][TFSA], the Li(+)transference number estimated using the potentiostatic polarisation method (tPPLi = 0.028) was considerably lower than that estimated using the self-diffusion coefficient data with pulsed filed gradient (PFG)-NMR (tNMRLi = 0.52). The dynamic ion correlations (i.e., cation-cation, anion-anion, and cation-anion cross-correlations) were determined from the experimental data on the basis of Roling and Bedrov's concentrated solution theory, and the results suggest that the strongly negative cross-correlations of the ion motions (especially for cation-cation motions) are responsible for the extremely lowtPPLi of [Li(G4)][TFSA]. In contrast,tPPLi is larger thantNMRLi in the SL-based electrolytes. The hightPPLi of the SL-based electrolytes was ascribed to the substantially weaker anti-correlations of cation-cation and cation-anion motions. Whereas the translational motions of the long-lived [Li(glyme)](+)and [TFSA](-)dominate the ionic conduction for [Li(G4)][TFSA], Li ion hopping/exchange conduction was reported to be prevalent in the SL-based electrolytes. The unique Li ion conduction mechanism is considered to contribute to the less correlated cation-cation and cation-anion motions in SL-based electrolytes.",16
"Rechargeable aluminum-organic batteries are composed of earth-abundant, sustainable electrode mate-rials while the molecular structures of the organic molecules can be controlled to tune their electrochem-ical properties. Aluminum metal batteries typically use electrolytes based on chloroaluminate ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents that are comprised of polyatomic aluminum-containing species. Quinone-based organic electrodes store charge when chloroaluminous cations (AlCl2+) charge compensate their electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups, even when such cations are not natively present in the electrolyte. However, how ion speciation in the electrolyte affects the ion charge storage mechanism, and resultant battery performance, is not well understood. Here, we couple solid-state NMR spectroscopy with electrochemical and computational methods to show for the first time that electrolyte-dependent ion speciation significantly alters the molecular-level environments of the charge-compensating cations, which in turn influences battery properties. Using 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone (DCQ) for the first time as an organic electrode material, we utilize solid-state dipolar-mediated and multiple-quantum NMR exper-iments to elucidate distinct aluminum coordination environments upon discharge that depend signifi-cantly on electrolyte speciation. We relate DFT-calculated NMR parameters to experimentally determined quantities, revealing insights into their origins. The results establish that electrolyte ion spe-ciation impacts the local environments of charge-compensating chloroaluminous cations and is a crucial design parameter for rechargeable aluminum-quinone batteries.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"The effect of polymerizing 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) on the transport properties of the lithium (Li) ions in electrolytes from liquid to gel has been studied. After polymerization, liquid DOL electrolytes (LDOLEs) can form poly(1,3-dioxolane) (PDOL)-based electrolytes (PDOLEs), a gel polymer electrolyte with DOL as self-plasticizer. The chemical environment of Li+ ions is investigated with Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectrum. Compared with LDOLEs, the Li-7 NMR peaks of PDOLEs show upfield shift and increased full width at half-maximum, indicating more substantial shielding effect and larger Li+ solvates. The diffusion coefficients of Li+ ions ( D-LI(+)) are determined with pulsed field gradient NMR. The D-LI(+) in PDOLEs decreases about two orders of magnitude than that in LDOLEs. Larger activation enthalpy is needed for PDOLEs than LDOLEs to change the coordination state of Li+ ions due to the necessity of cooperative movement of several chain segments. The effect of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt concentration on the D-LI(+) is mainly ascribed to the change of mixing entropy (delta S). In PDOLEs, the delta S caused by the concentration variation has a more significant influence on the D-LI(+) than that in LDOLEs.",0
"The addition of plasticizers into Li+-conductive solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is a commonly known technique to enhance the ionic conductivity. Among the used plasticizers, alkoxides of group-13 elements [such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)borate ester] are promising candidates due to the Lewis acidity of the elements of this group (i.e. B, Al, and so on), which interact with the anions and may increase the degree of dissociation of the salts and the transport number of the SPEs. By means of pulsed-gradient stimulated-echo NMR (PGStE-NMR) and AC impedance measurements, we investigate the effect of Lewis acidity originated from group-13 elements on the transport number and the dissociation rate of SPEs containing various plasticizers. Our results show that the degree of salt dissociation is significantly enhanced by the addition of plasticizers including group-13 elements, whereas only a small or negligible increase of the transport number is observed for these SPEs. We infer that the plasticizers exhibiting Lewis acidity associate with the anions, and that the associated pairs can migrate in the SPEs as fast as free anions, which results in a lower transport number than expected.",9
"Electrochemical storage of energy is a necessary asset for the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power into a complete energy scenario. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are the only type of battery in which the energy content and the power output can be scaled independently, offering flexibility for applications such as load levelling. However, the prevailing technology, the all Vanadium system, comprises low energy and low power densities. In this study we investigate two polyoxometalates (POMs), [SiW12O40](4-) and [PV14O42](9-), as nano-sized electron shuttles. We show that these POMs exhibit fast redox kinetics (electron transfer constant k(0) approximate to 10(-2) cm s(-1) for [SiW12O40](4-)), thereby enabling high power densities; in addition, they feature multi-electron transfer, realizing a high capacity per molecule; they do not cross cation exchange membranes, eliminating self-discharge through the separator; and they are chemically and electrochemically stable as shown by in situ NMR. In flow battery studies the theoretical capacity (10.7 A h L-1) could be achieved under operating conditions. The cell was cycled for 14 days with current densities in the range of 30 to 60 mA cm(-2) (155 cycles). The Coulombic efficiency was 94% during cycling. Very small losses occurred due to residual oxygen in the system. The voltage efficiency (approximate to 65% at 30 mA cm(-2)) was mainly affected by ohmic rather than kinetic losses. Pathways for further improvement are discussed.",0
"Designing new electrolytes requires a better understanding of the correlation between their transport properties and their molecular structure. In this work, we present a detailed study of ionic liquids and polymer gel electrolytes probing their structure and dynamics by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In particular, ammonium- and phosphonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) are combined with different LiTFSI concentrations, and then with different ratios of poly(methylmethacrylate) polymer. The temperature dependence of self-diffusion coefficients of mobile species, DLi+, DTFSI- and DP4441+ or DN4441+, measured by pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR spectroscopy obeys the Arrhenius equation. Diffusivity of [P4441][TFSI] ILs is found to be greater than those of the [N4441][TFSI] ILs in both liquid and gel electrolytes. Solid state NMR experiments including C-13 and F-19 MAS, C-13{F-19},C-13{H-1} CPMAS probe the local structure and molecular-level interactions between ions and polymer in gel electrolytes, particularly for samples with higher PMMA content (>= 25 wt%). Finally, the fast field cycling relaxometry has been used to unveil the rotational and translational dynamics of P4441(+) or N4441(+) and TFSI- by measuring H-1 and (FR1)-F-19 relaxation rate profiles at different temperatures. A comprehensive NMR analysis including relaxation studies at low magnetic field provides decisive new insights regarding the formation of ionic clusters and the interaction of ions with the polymer chain in the case of the gel electrolytes.

"Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and vinylene carbonate (VC) are widely used as electrolyte additives in lithium ion batteries. Here we analyze the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on binder-free silicon nanowire (SiNW) electrodes in pure FEC or VC electrolytes containing 1 M LiPF6 by solid-state NMR with and without dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancement. We find that the polymeric SEIs formed in pure FEC or VC electrolytes consist mainly of cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and aliphatic chain functionalities along with additional carbonate and carboxylate species. The formation of branched fragments is further confirmed by C-13-C-13 correlation NMR experiments. The presence of cross-linked PEO-type polymers in FEC and VC correlates with good capacity retention and high Coulombic efficiencies of the SiNVVs. Using Si-29 DNP NMR, we are able to probe the interfacial region between SEI and the Si surface for the first time with NMR spectroscopy. Organosiloxanes form upon cycling, confirming that some of the organic SEI is covalently bonded to the Si surface. We suggest that both the polymeric structure of the SEI and the nature of its adhesion to the redox-active materials are important for electrochemical performance.",0
"Research on solid ionic conductors for use as electrolytes in all solid state batteries still constitutes a rather vivid branch of today's materials science. Despite enormous efforts, neither the development of a solid electrolyte fulfilling the key requirements such as mechanical stability and high ionic conductivity at ambient temperature has been successful nor has an extended understanding of the local Li coordination motifs in the often amorphous systems been obtained. In this contribution, recent progress both in the development of novel solid state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and mechanical stability and in the characterization of the local Li coordination motifs in these electrolytes from our laboratory is presented. The work was performed as a project within the framework of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 458 Ionic Motion in Materials with Disordered Structures From Elementary Steps to Macroscopic Transport. Results will be given for polymer electrolytes based on polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyphosphazene (PPZ) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with various Li salts, nano-composites of these polymer electrolytes and Al2O3 as a ceramic filler, novel inorganic/organic hybrid electrolytes, in which a mixture of an ionic liquid and Li salt is confined within the pore system of a SiO2 glass, and a crystalline electrolyte, Li5La3Nb2O12. Employing a range of advanced solid state NMR methodologies including dipolar based NMR techniques and pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR and impedance spectroscopy we were able to obtain a detailed knowledge about the local Li cation coordination motifs and the mechanism of Li transport in these electrolytes. Especially the hybrid electrolytes and the salt rich PAN based polymer electrolytes were identified as rather promising materials which combine a high ionic conductivity and mechanical stability.",7
"With the rapid iteration of portable electronics and electric vehicles, developing high-capacity batteries with ultra-fast charging capability has become a holy grail. Here we report rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries capable of reaching a high specific capacity of 200 mAh g−1. When liquid metal is further used to lower the energy barrier from the anode, fastest charging rate of 104 C (duration of 0.35 s to reach a full capacity) and 500% more specific capacity under high-rate conditions are achieved. Phase boundaries from the active anode are believed to encourage a high-flux charge transfer through the electric double layers. As a result, cationic layers inside the electric double layers responded with a swift change in molecular conformation, but anionic layers adopted a polymer-like configuration to facilitate the change in composition.",5
"High-performance flexible batteries are promising energy storage devices for portable and wearable electronics. Currently, the major obstacle to develop flexible batteries is the shortage of flexible electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance. Another challenge is the limited progress in the flexible batteries beyond Li-ion because of a safety concern for the Li-based electrochemical system. In this work, a self-supported tin sulfide (SnS) porous film (PF) is fabricated as a flexible cathode material in an Al-ion battery, which delivers a high specific capacity of 406 mAh g−1. A capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle is achieved, indicating a good stability. The self-supported and flexible SnS film also shows an outstanding electrochemical performance and stability during dynamic and static bending tests. In situ transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the porous structure of SnS is beneficial for minimizing the volume expansion during charge/discharge. This leads to an improved structural stability and superior long-term cyclability.",5
"As an emerging post-lithium battery technology, aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) have the advantages of large Al reserves and high safety, and have great potential to be applied to power grid energy storage. But current graphite cathode materials are limited in charge storage capacity due to the formation of stage-4 graphite-intercalated compounds (GICs) in the fully charged state. Herein, we propose a new type of cathode materials for AIBs, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which resemble graphite in terms of the large conjugated π bond, but do not form GICs in the charge process. Quantum chemistry calculations show that PAHs can bind AlCl4− through the interaction between the conjugated π bond in the PAHs and AlCl4−, forming on-plane interactions. The theoretical specific capacity of PAHs is negatively correlated with the number of benzene rings in the PAHs. Then, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, anthracene, a three-ring PAH, was evaluated as a cathode material for AIBs. Electrochemical measurements show that anthracene has a high specific capacity of 157 mAh g−1 (at 100 mA g−1) and still maintains a specific capacity of 130 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a feasible “theory guides practice” research model for the development of energy storage materials, and also provides a new class of promising cathode materials for AIBs.",5
"Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are attractive new generation energy storage devices due to its low cost, high specific capacity, and good safety. However, the lack of suitable electrode materials with high capacity and enhanced rate performance makes it difficult for real applications. Herein, the preparation of 3D reduced graphene oxide-supported SnS2 nanosheets hybrid is reported as a new type of cathode material for AIBs. The resultant material demonstrates one of the highest capacities of 392 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and good cycling stability. It is revealed that the layered SnS2 nanosheets anchored on 3D reduced graphene oxide network endows the composite not only high electronic conductivity but also fast kinetic diffusion pathway. As a result, the hybrid material exhibits high rate performance (112 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1). The detailed characterization also verifies the intercalation and deintercalation of relatively large chloroaluminate anions into the layered SnS2 during the charge–discharge process, which is important for better understanding of the electrochemical process of AIBs.",5
"Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are considered as a new generation of large-scale energy-storage devices due to their attractive features of abundant aluminum source, high specific capacity, and high energy density. However, AIBs suffer from a lack of suitable cathode materials with desirable capacity and long-term stability, which severely restricts the practical application of AIBs. Herein, a binder-free and self-standing cobalt sulfide encapsulated in carbon nanotubes is reported as a novel cathode material for AIBs. The resultant new electrode material exhibits not only high discharge capacity (315 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1) and enhanced rate performance (154 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), but also extraordinary cycling stability (maintains 87 mA h g−1 after 6000 cycles at 1 A g−1). The free-standing feature of the electrode also effectively suppresses the side reactions and material disintegrations in AIBs. The new findings reported here highlight the possibility for designing high-performance cathode materials for scalable and flexible AIBs.",5
"In recent years, a rechargeable aluminum-ion battery based on ionic liquid electrolyte is being extensively explored due to three-electron electrochemical reactions, rich resources, and safety. Herein, a rechargeable Al-ion battery composed of MoS2 microsphere cathode, aluminum anode, and ionic liquid electrolyte has been fabricated for the first time. It can be found that Al3+ intercalates into the MoS2 during the electrochemical reaction, whereas the storage mechanisms of the electrode material interface and internal are quite different. This result is confirmed by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction etching techniques. Meanwhile, this aluminum-ion battery also shows excellent electrochemical performance, such as a discharge specific capacity of 253.6 mA h g–1 at a current density of 20 mA g–1 and a discharge capacity of 66.7 mA h g–1 at a current density of 40 mA g–1 after 100 cycles. This will lay a solid foundation for the commercialization of aluminum-ion batteries.",5
"Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) are regarded as the next generation of low-cost and high-capacity electrical energy storage systems. Compared to graphene-based cathodes, metal dichalcogenide cathodes can potentially provide RAIBs with higher capacities. However, metal dichalcogenides suffer from poor cycling performance, hindering the further development of high-capacity RAIBs. Thus, to further improve the performance of RAIBs, it is imperative to gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms behind the energy-storage and capacity-deterioration characteristics of these materials. In this work, we conducted detailed characterization to acquire a deep understanding of the energy storage mechanism of a CoSe2-based cathode. The characterization results revealed that energy storage involved incorporation of Al3+ into CoSe2 to generate AlmConSe2 (i.e., partial substitution of Co2+ by Al3+) and elemental Co, while capacity deterioration resulted from the dissolution of active cobalt species into the electrolyte and the pulverization of the CoSe2 phase. The understanding of the capacity-deterioration mechanism allowed us to design a two-step concept for a new type of RAIB composite cathode material. Thus, we employed a conductive wrapping layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to protect CoSe2/carbon nanodice composites from cobalt dissolution and CoSe2 pulverization while also improving the conductivity of the materials. This novel design resulted in a CoSe2/carbon nanodice@rGO composite material with an outstanding cycling performance (after 500 cycles) of 143 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1, which is one of the best performances for a metal-based RAIB cathode material reported to date. These findings are of great significance for the further development of high-capacity RAIBs.",5
"The relation between the performance of a self-humidifying H-2/O-2 polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and the amount and distribution of water as observed using H-1 NMR microscopy was investigated. The integrated H-1 NMR image signal intensity (proportional to water content) from the region of the polymer electrolyte membrane between the catalyst layers was found to correlate well with the power output of the fuel cell. Several examples are provided which demonstrate the sensitivity of the H-1 NMR image intensity to the operating conditions of the fuel cell. Changes in the O-2(g) flow rate cause predictable trends in both the power density and the image intensity. Higher power densities, achieved by decreasing the resistance of the external circuit, were found to increase the water in the PEM. An observed plateau of both the power density and the integrated H-1 NMR image signal intensity from the membrane electrode assembly and subsequent decline of the power density is postulated to result from the accumulation of H2O(l) in the gas diffusion layer and cathode flow field. The potential of using H-1 NMR microscopy to obtain the absolute water content of the polymer electrolyte membrane is discussed and several recommendations for future research are provided.",16
"Redox flow batteries are considered a promising technology for grid energy storage. However, capacity decay caused by crossover of active materials is a universal challenge for many flow battery systems, which are based on various chemistries. In this paper, using the vanadium redox flow battery as an example, we demonstrate a new gel polymer interface (GPI) consisting of crosslinked polyethyleneimine with a large amount of amino and carboxylic acid groups introduced between the positive electrode and the membrane. The GPI functions as a key component to prevent vanadium ions from crossing the membrane, thus supporting stable long-term cycling. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to investigate the effect of GPI on the electrochemical properties of graphitic carbon electrodes (GCFs) and redox reaction of catholyte. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra demonstrated that the crosslinked GPI is chemically stable for 100 cycles without dissolution of polymers and swelling in the strong acidic electrolytes. Results from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy proved that the GPI is effective in maintaining the concentration of vanadium species in their respective half-cells, resulting in improved cycling stability because of it prevents active species from crossing the membrane and stabilizes the oxidation states of active species.",9
"A composite polymer electrolyte LiTFSI-DMMP/PFSA-Li based on a lithiated perfluorinated sulfonic ion-exchange membrane (PFSA-Li) impregnated with 1.0 M LiTFSI-DMMP (dimethyl methyl phosphonate) solution was prepared and employed in the lithium/oxygen cell for the first time. The ionic conductivity of the composite electrolyte was measured to be ca. 1.4 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C. The lithium/oxygen cells using this composite electrolyte and a cobalt catalyst cathode showed high discharge capacities of 3585 mAh g(-1) (0.2 mA cm(-2)), 2845 mAh g(-1) (0.4 mA cm(-2)) and 2413 mAh g(-1) (1 mA cm(-2)), respectively. The cycling performance of the Li vertical bar LiTFSI-DMMP/PFSA-Li vertical bar O-2 cell is better than a typical Li vertical bar LiTFSI-PC+DEC/PVDF-HFP vertical bar O-2 cell, however is still far from satisfactory. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the discharge products of the Li vertical bar LiTFSI-DMMP/PFSA-Li vertical bar O-2 cell are mainly lithium oxides. The capacity fading is probably due to the pore blocking on oxygen electrode and also the degradation of the Li anode. H-1, C-13 and P-31 NMR experiments show no evidence of electrolyte degradation during cell cycling. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10.1149/2.012212jes] All rights reserved.",3
"The pivotal role of CO2 played in global temperature cycles has motivated the ongoing research on carbon capture and storage (CCS). Within this context, Li-CO2 battery, alike the configuration of Li-O-2 battery, has been proposed as a novel energy storage device with the potential to reduce CO2. Nevertheless, the highly negative potential required for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 adds difficulty to the achievement of energy efficient Li-CO2 battery. Facilitating the electron transfer to this inert molecule, which largely dictates the discharge voltage and rate capability of a Li-CO2 battery, is therefore necessary. Herein, three types of quinones have been surveyed, aiming to mediate the reduction of CO2, which is expected to result in lower overpotential than with a direct electron transfer. We demonstrate by cyclic voltammetry that, in the presence of quinones, CO2 reduction proceeds through an intermolecular interaction between CO2 and quinone dianion. Importantly, such catalytic CO2 reduction reaction is associated with the molecular structure of quinones, the supporting cation (e.g., Li+), and the electrolyte solvent. Furthermore, Li-CO2 battery mediated by 2,5-ditert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone with Li2CO3 as the ultimate discharge product is achieved. This study validates the concept of using quinones as chemical catalysts to promote CO2 reduction in Li-CO2 battery. Besides, battery performance and NMR analysis together suggest that side reactions involving quinone itself and other cell components occur.",16
